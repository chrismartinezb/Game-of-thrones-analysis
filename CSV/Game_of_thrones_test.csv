WAYMAR ROYCE," What d’you expect? They’re savages. One lot steals a goat from another lot and before you know it, they’re ripping each other to pieces.",1,1
WILL," I’ve never seen wildlings do a thing like this. I’ve never seen a thing like this, not ever in my life.",1,1
WAYMAR ROYCE, How close did you get?,1,1
WILL, Close as any man would.,1,1
GARED, We should head back to the wall.,1,1
ROYCE, Do the dead frighten you?,1,1
GARED, Our orders were to track the wildlings. We tracked them. They won’t trouble us no more.,1,1
ROYCE, You don’t think he’ll ask us how they died? Get back on your horse.,1,1
WILL, Whatever did it to them could do it to us. They even killed the children.,1,1
ROYCE," It’s a good thing we’re not children. You want to run away south, run away. Of course, they will behead you as a deserter … If I don’t catch you first. Get back on your horse. I won’t say it again.",1,1
ROYCE, Your dead men seem to have moved camp.,1,1
WILL, They were here.,1,1
GARED, See where they went.,1,1
ROYCE, What is it?,1,1
GARED, It’s …,1,1
JON, Go on. Father’s watching.,1,1
JON, And your mother.,1,1
SEPTA MORDANE (to SANSA)," Fine work, as always. Well done.",1,1
SANSA, Thank you.,1,1
SEPTA MORDANE, I love the detail that you’ve managed to get in this corners. … Quite beautiful … the stitching …,1,1
NED," And which one of you was a marksman at ten? Keep practicing, Bran. Go on.",1,1
JON," Don’t think too much, Bran.",1,1
ROBB, Relax your bow arm.,1,1
JON/ROBB," Quick, Bran, faster!",1,1
CASSEL, Lord Stark. My lady. A guardsman just rode in from the hills. They’ve captured a deserter from the Night’s Watch.,1,1
NED, Get the lads to saddle their horses.,1,1
CATELYN, Do you have to?,1,1
NED," He swore an oath, Cat.",1,1
CASSEL," The law is law, my lady.",1,1
NED," Tell Bran he’s coming, too.",1,1
CATELYN, Ned. Ten is too young to see such things.,1,1
NED, He won’t be a boy forever. And winter is coming.,1,1
ROBB," Lad, go run back and get the rest.",1,1
WILL (muttering)," White Walkers. I saw the White Walkers. White Walkers. The White Walkers, I saw them.",1,1
WILL," I know I broke my oath. And I know I’m a deserter. I should have gone back to the Wall and warned them. But I saw what I saw. I saw the White Walkers. People need to know. If you can get word to my family, tell them I’m no coward. Tell them I’m sorry.",1,1
WILL (whispering)," Forgive me, lord.",1,1
NED," In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, first of his name …",1,1
JON (to BRAN), Don’t look away.,1,1
NED, King of the Andals and the First Men …,1,1
JON, Father will know if you do.,1,1
NED," Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and protector of the realm, I, Eddard of the House Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, sentence you to die.",1,1
JON, You did well.,1,1
NED, You understand why I did it?,1,1
BRAN, Jon said he was a deserter.,1,1
NED, But do you understand why I had to kill him?,1,1
BRAN, Our way is the old way?,1,1
NED, The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword.,1,1
BRAN, Is it true he saw the White Walkers?,1,1
NED, The White Walkers have been gone for thousands of years.,1,1
BRAN, So he was lying?,1,1
NED, A madman sees what he sees.,1,1
JON, What is it?,1,1
THEON, Mountain lion?,1,1
NED, There are no mountain lions in these woods.,1,1
THEON, It’s a freak.,1,1
NED, It’s a direwolf.,1,1
NED, Tough old beast.,1,1
ROBB, There are no direwolves south of the Wall.,1,1
JON, Now there are five.,1,1
JON, You want to hold it?,1,1
BRAN, Where will they go? Their mother’s dead.,1,1
CASSEL, They don’t belong down here.,1,1
NED, Better a quick death. They won’t last without their mother.,1,1
THEON, Right. Give it here.,1,1
BRAN, NO!,1,1
ROBB (disgustedly to THEON), Put away your blade.,1,1
THEON," I take orders from your father, not you.",1,1
BRAN," Please, father!",1,1
NED," I’m sorry, Bran.",1,1
JON, Lord Stark? There are five pups. One for each of the Stark children. The direwolf is the sigil of your House. They were meant to have them.,1,1
NED," You will train them yourselves. You will feed them yourselves. And if they die, you will bury them yourselves.",1,1
BRAN (to JON), What about you?,1,1
JON, I’m not a Stark. Get on.,1,1
ROBB, What is it?,1,1
THEON," The runt of the litter. That one’s yours, Snow.",1,1
JAIME," As your brother, I feel it’s my duty to warn you: You worry too much. It’s starting to show.",1,1
JAIME," As your brother, I feel it’s my duty to warn you: You worry too much. It’s starting to show.",1,1
CERSEI," And you never worry about anything. When we were seven, you jumped off the cliffs as Casterly Rock. One hundred foot drop into the water. And you were never afraid.",1,1
JAIME," There was nothing to be afraid of until you told father. [In a whisper, mimicking] We’re Lannisters. Lannisters don’t act like fools.",1,1
CERSEI, What if Jon Arryn told someone?,1,1
JAIME, But who would he tell?,1,1
CERSEI, My husband.,1,1
JAIME," If he told the king, both our heads would be skewered on the city gates by now. Whatever Jon Arryn knew or didn’t know, it died with him. And Robert will choose a new Hand of the king, someone to do his job while he’s off fucking boars and hunting whores. Or is it the other way around? And life will go on.",1,1
CERSEI, You should be the Hand of the king.,1,1
JAIME," That’s an honor I can do without. Their days are too long, their lives are too short.",1,1
CATELYN, All these years and I still feel like an outsider when I come here.,1,1
NED, You have five northern children. You’re not an outsider.,1,1
CATELYN, I wonder if the old gods agree.,1,1
NED, It’s your gods with all the rules.,1,1
CATELYN," I am so sorry, my love.",1,1
NED, Tell me.,1,1
CATELYN, There was a raven from Kings Landing. Jon Arryn is dead. A fever took him. I know he was like a father to you.,1,1
NED, Your sister. The boy …,1,1
CATELYN, They both have their health. Gods be good. [pause] The raven brought more news. The king rides for Winterfell. With the queen and all the rest of them.,1,1
NED," He’s coming this far North, there’s only one thing he’s after.",1,1
CATELYN," You can always say no, Ned.",1,1
CATELYN, We need plenty of candles for Lord Tyrion’s chamber. I’m told he reads all night.,1,1
MAESTER LUWIN, I’m told he drinks all night.,1,1
CATELYN, How much could he possibly drink? A man of his … stature.,1,1
LUWIN, We’ve brought up eight barrels of ale from the cellar. Perhaps we’ll find out.,1,1
CATELYN," In any case, candles.",1,1
JON, Why’s your mother so dead-set on us getting pretty for the king?,1,1
THEON," It’s for the queen, I bet. I hear she’s [sleek as a mink?]",1,1
ROBB, I hear the prince is a right royal prick.,1,1
THEON, Think of all those southern girls he gets to stab with his right royal prick.,1,1
ROBB," Go on, Tommy, shave him good. He’s never met a girl he likes better than his own hair.",1,1
CATELYN," Gods, but they grow fast. [Seeing BRAN on the wall] Brandon!",1,1
BRAN, I saw the king! He’s got hundreds of people!,1,1
CATELYN, How many times have I told you: No climbing!,1,1
CATELYN, How many times have I told you: No climbing!,1,1
BRAN, But he’s coming right now! Down our road!,1,1
CATELYN, I want you to promise me: No more climbing.,1,1
CATELYN, I want you to promise me: No more climbing.,1,1
BRAN (looking down), I promise.,1,1
CATELYN, D’you know what?,1,1
BRAN, What?,1,1
CATELYN, You always look at your feet before you lie. Run and find your father. Tell him the king is close.,1,1
CATELYN," Where’s Arya? Sansa, where’s your sister?",1,1
NED," Hey,, hey, hey, hey. What are you doing with that on? [Pulls off ARYA’s helm]",1,1
ARYA (pushing BRAN), Move!,1,1
NED, Your Grace.,1,1
ROBERT, You’ve got fat.,1,1
ROBERT, Cat!,1,1
CATELYN, Your Grace.,1,1
ROBERT, Nine years. Why haven’t I seen you? Where the hell have you been?,1,1
NED," Guarding the North for you, Your Grace. Winterfell is yours.",1,1
ARYA, Where’s the Imp?,1,1
SANSA, Will you shut up?,1,1
ROBERT," Who have we here? You must be Robb. (To Sansa) My, you’re a pretty one. (To Arya) Your name is?",1,1
ARYA, Arya.,1,1
ARYA, That’s Jaime Lannister. The queen’s twin brother.,1,1
SANSA, Would you please shut up.,1,1
NED, My queen.,1,1
CATELYN, My queen.,1,1
ROBERT, Take me to your crypt. I want to pay my respects.,1,1
CERSEI," We’ve been riding for a month, my love. Surely the dead can wait.",1,1
ROBERT, Ned.,1,1
ARYA, Where’s the Imp?,1,1
CERSEI, Where is our brother? Go find the little beast.,1,1
NED, Tell me about Jon Arryn.,1,1
ROBERT," One minute he was fine, and then … Burned right through him, whatever it was. I loved that man.",1,1
NED, We both did.,1,1
ROBERT," He never had to teach you much, but me … You remember me at 16? All I wanted to do was crack skulls and fuck girls. He showed me what was what.",1,1
NED, Aye.,1,1
ROBERT," Don’t look at me like that. Not his fault I didn’t listen. (They laugh. ROBERT sighs.) I need you, Ned. Down at Kings Landing. Not up here, where you’re no damn use to anybody. Lord Eddard Stark, I would name you the Hand of the king.",1,1
NED, I’m not worthy of the honor.,1,1
ROBERT," I’m not trying to honor you. I’m trying to get you to run my kingdom while I eat, drink, and whore my way to an early grave. Damn it, Ned, stand up. You helped me win the Iron Throne, now help me keep the damn thing. We were meant to rule together. If your sister had lived, we would have been bound by blood. Well, it’s not too late. I have a son, you have a daughter. We’ll join our Houses.",1,1
TYRION, Mmh. It is true what they say about the Northern girls.,1,1
ROS, Did you hear the king’s in Winterfell?,1,1
TYRION, I did hear something about that.,1,1
ROS, And the queen. And her twin brother. They say that he is the most handsome man in the Seven Kingdoms.,1,1
TYRION, And the other brother?,1,1
ROS, The queen has two brothers?,1,1
TYRION, There’s the pretty one. And there’s the clever one.,1,1
ROS, I hear they call him the Imp.,1,1
TYRION, I hear he hates that nickname.,1,1
ROS, Oh? I hear he’s more than earned it. I hear he’s a drunken little lecher into all manner of perversions.,1,1
TYRION, Clever girl.,1,1
ROS," We’ve been expecting you, Lord Tyrion.",1,1
TYRION, Have you?,1,1
TYRION, The gods gave me one blessing.,1,1
JAIME, Don’t get up.,1,1
ROS, M’lord.,1,1
TYRION," Should I explain to you the meaning of a closed door in a whorehouse, brother?",1,1
JAIME," You’ve much to teach me, no doubt. But our sister craves your attention.",1,1
TYRION," She has odd cravings, our sister.",1,1
JAIME," A family trait. Now, the Starks are feasting us at sundown. Don’t leave me alone with these people.",1,1
TYRION," I’m sorry, I’ve begun the feast a bit early. And this is the first of many courses.",1,1
JAIME," I thought you might say that. But since we’re short on time, (he opens the door; a bevy of whores enter and descend on TYRION) Come on, girls. See you at sundown.",1,1
TYRION, Close the door!,1,1
ROBERT, Did you have to bury her in a place like this? She should be on a hill somewhere with the sun and the clouds above her.,1,1
NED, She was my sister. This is where she belongs.,1,1
ROBERT, She belonged with me.,1,1
ROBERT," In my dreams, I kill him every night.",1,1
NED," It’s done, Your Grace. The Targaryens are gone.",1,1
ROBERT, Not all of them.,1,1
VISERYS (off camera), Daenerys!,1,1
VISERYS, Daenerys! There’s our bride to be! Look – a gift from Illyrio. Touch it. Come on. Feel the fabric. Mmmm. Isn’t he a gracious host?,1,1
DAENERYS, We’ve been his guests for over a year and he’s never asked us for anything.,1,1
VISERYS," Illyrio is no fool. He knows I won’t forget my friends when I come into my throne. You still slouch. Let me see. (He pulls off her gown.) You have a woman’s body now. (She endures it as he strokes her breast.) I need you to be perfect today. Can you do that for me? You don’t want to wake the dragon, do you?",1,1
DAENERYS, No.,1,1
VISERYS," When they write the history of my reign, sweet sister, they will say it began today.",1,1
MAID," It’s too hot, my lady.",1,1
VISERYS, Where is he?,1,1
ILLYRIO, The Dothraki are not known for their punctuality.,1,1
ILLYRIO," (Greets them in Dothraki.) May I present my honored guests? Viserys of House Targaryen, the third of his name. The rightful King of the Andals and the First Men. And his sister, Daenerys, of the House Targaryen.",1,1
ILLYRIO," Come forward, my dear.",1,1
VISERYS, Where’s he going?,1,1
ILLYRIO, The ceremony is over.,1,1
VISERYS, But he didn’t say anything. Did he like her?,1,1
ILLYRIO," Trust me, Your Grace. If he didn’t like her, we’d know.",1,1
ILLYRIO, It won’t be long now. Soon you will cross the Narrow Sea and take back your father’s throne. The people drink secret toasts to your health. They cry out for their true king.,1,1
VISERYS, When will they be married?,1,1
ILLYRIO, Soon. The Dothraki never stay still for long.,1,1
VISERYS, Is it true they lie with their horses?,1,1
ILLYRIO, I wouldn’t ask Khal Drogo.,1,1
VISERYS, Do you take me for a fool?,1,1
ILLYRIO, I take you for a king. Kings lack the caution of common men. My apologies if I’ve given offense.,1,1
VISERYS, I know how to play a man like Drogo. I give him a queen and he gives me an army.,1,1
VISERYS," So do I. I want us both to go home. But they took it from us. So tell me, sweet sister, how do we go home?",1,1
DAENERYS, I don’t know.,1,1
VISERYS," We go home with an army. With Khal Drogo’s army. I would let his whole tribe fuck you, all 40,000 men and their horses too, if that’s what it took.",1,1
SANSA, Do you think Joffrey will like me? What if he thinks I’m ugly?,1,1
CATELYN, Then he is the stupidest prince that ever lived.,1,1
SANSA, He’s so handsome.,1,1
SANSA, When would we be married? Soon or do we have to wait?,1,1
CATELYN, Hush now. Your father hasn’t even said yes.,1,1
SANSA, Why would he say no? He’d be the second most powerful man in the kingdoms.,1,1
CATELYN, He’d have to leave home. He’d have to leave me. And so would you.,1,1
SANSA, You left your home to come here. And I’d be queen someday. Please make father say yes.,1,1
CATELYN, Sansa…,1,1
SANSA," Please, please. It’s the only thing I ever wanted.",1,1
BENJEN, Is he dead yet?,1,1
JON, Uncle Benjen!,1,1
BENJEN, You got bigger. I rode all day. Didn’t want to leave you alone with the Lannisters. Why aren’t you at the feast?,1,1
JON, Lady Stark thought it might insult the royal family to seat a bastard in their midst.,1,1
BENJEN," Well, you’re always welcome on the wall. No bastard was ever refused a seat there.",1,1
JON, So take me with you when you go back.,1,1
BENJEN, Jon…,1,1
JON," Father will let me if you ask him, I know he will.",1,1
BENJEN, The Wall isn’t going anywhere.,1,1
JON, I’m ready to swear your oath.,1,1
BENJEN, You don’t understand what you’d be giving up. We have no families. None of us will ever father sons.,1,1
JON, I don’t care about that.,1,1
BENJEN," You might, if you knew what it meant. … I’d better get inside. Rescue your father from his guests. We’ll talk later.",1,1
TYRION, Your uncle’s in the Night’s Watch.,1,1
JON, What’re you doing back there?,1,1
TYRION (drinking), Preparing for a night with your family. I’ve always wanted to see the Wall.,1,1
JON, You’re Tyrion Lannister. The queen’s brother?,1,1
TYRION," My greatest accomplishment. You – you’re Ned Stark’s bastard, aren’t you?",1,1
TYRION," Did I offend you? Sorry. You are the bastard, though.",1,1
JON, Lord Eddard Stark is my father.,1,1
TYRION," And Lady Stark is not your mother. Making you a bastard. Let me give you some advice, bastard. Never forget what you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor. Then it can never be used to hurt you.",1,1
JON, What the hell do you know about being a bastard?,1,1
TYRION, All dwarves are bastards in their fathers’ eyes.,1,1
BENJEN, You at a feast -- It’s like a bear in a trap.,1,1
NED, The boy I beheaded. Did you know him?,1,1
BENJEN," Of course I did. Just a lad. But he was tough, Ned. A true Ranger.",1,1
NED, He was talking madness. Said the Walkers slaughtered his friends.,1,1
BENJEN, The two he was with are still missing.,1,1
NED, A wildling ambush.,1,1
BENJEN, Maybe. Direwolves south of the wall. Talk of the Walkers. My brother might be the next Hand to the king. Winter is coming.,1,1
NED, Winter is coming.,1,1
ROBB, Uncle Benjen.,1,1
BENJEN, Robb boy. How are ye?,1,1
ROBB, I’m good.,1,1
CERSEI, Yes. Lovely country.,1,1
CATELYN," I’m sure it’s very grim, after Kings Landing. I remember how scared I was when Ned brought me up here for the first time.",1,1
CERSEI," Hello, little dove. But you are a beauty. How old are you?",1,1
SANSA," Thirteen, Your Grace.",1,1
CERSEI, You’re tall. Still growing?,1,1
SANSA," I think so, Your Grace.",1,1
CERSEI, And have you bled yet?,1,1
SANSA (discomfited)," No, Your Grace.",1,1
CERSEI, And your dress. Did you make it?,1,1
CERSEI, Such talent. You must make something for me.,1,1
CERSEI (to CATELYN], I hear we might share a grandchild someday.,1,1
CATELYN, I hear the same.,1,1
CERSEI, Your daughter will do well in the capital. Such a beauty shouldn’t stay hidden up here forever.,1,1
NED, Your pardon.,1,1
JAIME, I hear we might be neighbors soon. I hope it’s true.,1,1
NED," Yes, the king has honored me with his offer.",1,1
JAIME," I’m sure we’ll have a tournament to celebrate the new title, if you accept. It would be good to have you in the field. The competition has become a bit stale.",1,1
NED, I don’t fight in tournaments.,1,1
JAIME, No? Getting a little old for it?,1,1
NED," I don’t fight in tournaments because when I fight a man for real, I don’t want him to know what I can do.",1,1
JAIME, Well said.,1,1
SANSA, Arya!,1,1
ROBB, Time for bed.,1,1
NED," I’m a Northman. I belong here with you, not down south in that rat’s nest they call a capital.",1,1
CATELYN, I won’t let him take you.,1,1
NED, The king takes what he wants. That’s why he’s king.,1,1
CATELYN," I’ll say, ‘Listen, fat man, you are not taking my husband anywhere. He belongs to me now.’",1,1
NED, How did he get so fat?,1,1
CATELYN, He only stops eating when it’s time for a drink.,1,1
A VOICE," It’s Maester Luwin, my lord.",1,1
NED, Send him in.,1,1
LUWIN," Pardon, my lord, my lady. A rider in the night from your sister.",1,1
NED, Stay.,1,1
CATELYN, This was sent from the Eyrie. What’s she doing at the Eyrie? She hasn’t been back there since her wedding.,1,1
NED, What news?,1,1
CATELYN, She’s fled the capital. She says Jon Arryn was murdered. By the Lannisters. She says the king is in danger.,1,1
NED," She’s fresh widowed, Cat. She doesn’t know what she’s saying.",1,1
CATELYN," Lysa’s head would be on a spike right now if the wrong people had found that letter. Do you think she would risk her life, her son’s life, if she wasn’t certain her husband was murdered?",1,1
LUWIN," If this news is true, and the Lannisters conspire against the throne, who but you can protect the king?",1,1
CATELYN, They murdered the last Hand. Now you want Ned to take the job.,1,1
LUWIN," The king rode for a month to ask Lord Stark’s help. He’s the only one he trusts. You swore the king an oath, my lord.",1,1
CATELYN, He spent half his life fighting Robert’s wars. He owes him nothing. (To NED) Your father and brother rode south once on a king’s demand.,1,1
LUWIN, A different time. Different king.,1,1
VISERYS, When do I meet with the Khal? We need to begin planning the invasion.,1,1
ILLYRIO," If Khal Drogo has promised you a crown, you shall have it.",1,1
VISERYS, When?,1,1
ILLYRIO, When their omens favor war.,1,1
VISERYS, I piss on Dothraki omens. I waited 17 years to get my throne back.,1,1
ILLYRIO, A Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is considered a dull affair.,1,1
JORAH, A small gift for the new Khaleesi. Songs and histories from the Seven Kingdoms.,1,1
DAENERYS," Thank you, ser. Are you from my country?",1,1
JORAH," Ser Jorah Mormont of Bear Island. I served your father for many years. Gods be good, I hope to always serve the rightful king.",1,1
ILLYRIO," Dragons’ eggs, Daenerys. From the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai. The ages have turned them to stone, but they will always be beautiful.",1,1
DAENERYS," Thank you, Magister.",1,1
DAENERYS," She’s beautiful. … Ser Jorah, I don’t know how to say ‘thank you’ in Dothraki.",1,1
JORAH, There is no word for ‘thank you’ in Dothraki.,1,1
VISERYS, Make him happy.,1,1
KHAL DROGO, No.,1,1
DAENERYS, Do you know the Common Tongue?,1,1
KHAL DROGO, No.,1,1
DAENERYS, Is ‘no’ the only word that you know?,1,1
KHAL DROGO, No.,1,1
THE HOUND," Rough night, Imp?",1,1
TYRION," If I get through this without squirting from one end or the other, it will be a miracle.",1,1
THE HOUND, I didn’t pick you for a hunter.,1,1
TYRION, The greatest in the land. My spear never misses.,1,1
THE HOUND, It’s not hunting if you pay for it.,1,1
ROBERT, Are you as good with a spear as you used to be?,1,1
NED," No, but I’m still better than you.",1,1
ROBERT, I know what I’m putting you through. Thank you for saying yes. I only ask you because I need you. You’re a loyal friend. You hear me? A loyal friend. The last one I’ve got.,1,1
NED, I hope I’ll serve you well.,1,1
ROBERT," You will. And I’ll make sure you don’t look so fucking grim all the time. Come on, boys, let’s go kill some boar!",1,1
BRAN," Come on, you.",1,1
CERSEI, Stop. STOP.,1,1
JAIME, Are you completely mad?,1,1
CERSEI, He saw us.,1,1
JAIME, It’s all right. It’s all right.,1,1
CERSEI, He saw us!,1,1
JAIME," I heard you the first time. (To BRAN) Quite the little climber, aren’t you? How old are you, boy?",1,1
BRAN, Ten,1,1
JAIME, Ten.,1,1
JAIME, The things I do for love.,1,1
Jorah Mormont," You need to drink, child... And eat.",1,2
Daenerys Targaryen, Isn't there anything else?,1,2
Jorah Mormont," The Dothraki have two things in abundance: grass and horses. People can't live on grass... In the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai, they say there are fields of ghost grass with stalks as pale as milk that glow in the night. It murders all other grass. The Dothraki believe that one day it will cover everything. That's the way the world will end… It'll get easier.",1,2
Jorah Mormont," The Dothraki have two things in abundance: grass and horses. People can't live on grass...

The Dothraki believe that one day it will cover everything. That's the way the world will end… It'll get easier.",1,2
Doreah, Khaleesi!,1,2
Irri, Your hands.,1,2
Jorah Mormont," We're still not far from Pentos, your Grace. Magister Illyrio has extended his hospitality. You'd be more comfortable there.",1,2
Viserys Targaryen, I have no interest in hospitality or comfort. I'll stay with Drogo until he fulfils his end of the bargain and I have my crown.,1,2
Jorah Mormont," As you wish, your Grace.",1,2
Viserys Targaryen," Well, Mormont, as brutish as this life is, I suppose it is preferable to beheading. What did Ned Stark want you for? Buying from a slaver?",1,2
Jorah Mormont, Selling to one... Some poachers I caught on my land.,1,2
Viserys Targaryen," Under my reign, you won't be punished for such nonsense. You can rest assured of that.",1,2
Joffrey Baratheon," Better-looking bitches than you're used to, Uncle. My mother's been looking for you. We ride for King's Landing today.",1,2
Tyrion Lannister," Before you go, you will call on Lord and Lady Stark and offer your sympathies.",1,2
Joffrey Baratheon, What good will my sympathies do them?,1,2
Tyrion Lannister, None. But it is expected of you. Your absence has already been noted.,1,2
Joffrey Baratheon, The boy means nothing to me. And I can't stand the wailing of women.,1,2
Tyrion Lannister, One word and I'll hit you again.,1,2
Joffrey Baratheon, I'm telling mother!,1,2
Tyrion Lannister," Go! Tell her. But first you will get to Lord and Lady Stark and you will fall on your knees in front of them and tell them how very sorry you are, that you are at their service, and that all your prayers are with them. Do you understand?",1,2
Joffrey Baratheon, You can't...,1,2
Tyrion Lannister, Do you understand?,1,2
Sandor Clegane," The Prince will remember that, little lord.",1,2
Tyrion Lannister," I hope so. If he forgets, be a good dog and remind him. Time for breakfast...",1,2
Tyrion Lannister," Bread. And two of those little fish. And a mug of dark beer to wash it down. And bacon, burnt black.",1,2
Jaime Lannister, Little brother.,1,2
Tyrion Lannister, Beloved siblings.,1,2
Myrcella Baratheon, Is Bran going to die?,1,2
Tyrion Lannister, Apparently not.,1,2
Cersei Baratheon, What do you mean?,1,2
Tyrion Lannister, The Maester says the boy may live.,1,2
Cersei Baratheon," It's no mercy, letting a child linger in such pain.",1,2
Tyrion Lannister, Only the gods know for certain. All the rest of us can do is pray. The charms of the north seem entirely lost on you.,1,2
Cersei Baratheon, I still can't believe you're going. It's ridiculous even for you.,1,2
Tyrion Lannister," Where's your sense of wonder? The greatest structure ever built, the intrepid men of the Night's Watch, the wintry abode of the White Walkers.",1,2
Jaime Lannister, Tell me you're not thinking of taking the black.,1,2
Tyrion Lannister, And go celibate? The whores would go begging from Dorne to Casterly Rock. I just want to stand on top of the Wall and piss off the edge of the world.,1,2
Cersei Baratheon, The children don't need to hear your filth. Come.,1,2
Jaime Lannister," Even if the boy lives, he'll be a cripple, a grotesque. Give me a good clean death any day.",1,2
Tyrion Lannister," Speaking for the grotesques, I'd have to disagree. Death is so final, whereas life... Life is full of possibilities. I hope the boy does wake. I'd be very interested to hear what he has to say.",1,2
Jaime Lannister," My dear brother, there are times you make me wonder whose side you're on.",1,2
Tyrion Lannister," My dear brother, you wound me. You know how much I love my family.",1,2
Cersei Baratheon, Please.,1,2
Catelyn Stark," I would have dressed, your Grace.",1,2
Cersei Baratheon," This is your home. I'm your guest. Handsome one, isn't he? I lost my first boy, a little black-haired beauty. He was a fighter too... Tried to beat the fever that took him. Forgive me. It's the last thing you need to hear right now.",1,2
Catelyn Stark, I never knew.,1,2
Cersei Baratheon," It was years ago. Robert was crazed, beat his hands bloody on the wall, all the things men do to show you how much they care... The boy looked just like him. Such a little thing... A bird without feathers. They came to take his body away and Robert held me. I screamed and I battled, but he held me. That little bundle. They took him away and I never saw him again. Never have visited the crypt, never. I pray to the Mother every morning and night that she return your child to you.",1,2
Catelyn Stark, I am grateful..,1,2
Cersei Baratheon, Perhaps this time she'll listen.,1,2
Jaime Lannister, A sword for the wall?,1,2
Jon Snow, I already have one.,1,2
Jaime Lannister, Good man. Have you swung it yet?,1,2
Jon Snow, Of course I have.,1,2
Jaime Lannister," At someone, I mean. It's a strange thing, the first time you cut a man. You realize we're nothing but sacks of meat and blood and some bone to keep it all standing. Let me thank you ahead of time for guarding us all from the perils beyond the Wall... Wildlings and White Walkers and whatnot. We're grateful to have good, strong men like you protecting us.",1,2
Jon Snow, We've guarded the Kingdoms for 8 000 years.,1,2
Jaime Lannister," Is it ""we"" already? Have you taken your vows then?",1,2
Jon Snow, Soon enough.,1,2
Jaime Lannister," Give my regards to the Night's Watch. I'm sure it will be thrilling to serve in such an elite force. And if not, It's only for life.",1,2
Arya Stark," Thank you, Nymeria. Septa Mordane says I have to do it again. ""My things weren't properly folded"", she says. Who cares how they're folded?! They're going to get all messed up anyway.",1,2
Jon Snow, It's good you've got help.,1,2
Arya Stark," Watch. Nymeria, gloves.",1,2
Jon Snow, Impressive.,1,2
Arya Stark," Shut up. Nymeria, gloves!",1,2
Jon Snow, I have something for you. And it has to be packed very carefully.,1,2
Arya Stark, A present?,1,2
Jon Snow, Close the door. This is no toy. Be careful you don't cut yourself.,1,2
Arya Stark, It's so skinny.,1,2
Jon Snow," So are you. I had the blacksmith make it for you special. It won't hack a man's head off, but it can poke him full of holes if you're quick enough.",1,2
Arya Stark, I can be quick.,1,2
Jon Snow, You'll have to work at it every day. How does it feel? Do you like the balance?,1,2
Arya Stark, I think so.,1,2
Jon Snow, First lesson: Stick them with the pointy end.,1,2
Jon Snow, First lesson: Stick them with the pointy end.,1,2
Arya Stark, I know which end to use.,1,2
Jon Snow," I'm going to miss you... Careful... All the best swords have names, you know.",1,2
Arya Stark, Sansa can keep her sewing needles. I've got a needle of my own.,1,2
Jon Snow, I came to say goodbye to Bran.,1,2
Catelyn Stark, You've said it.,1,2
Jon Snow," I wish I could be here when you wake up. I'm going north with Uncle Benjen. I'm taking the black. I know we always talked about seeing the Wall together, but you'll be able to come visit me at Castle Black when you're better. I'll know my way around by then. I'll be a sworn brother of the Night's Watch. We can go out walking beyond the Wall, if you're not afraid.",1,2
Catelyn Stark, I want you to leave.,1,2
Catelyn Stark, 17 years ago you rode off with Robert Baratheon. You came back a year later with another woman's son. And now you're leaving again.,1,2
Eddard Stark, I have no choice.,1,2
Catelyn Stark," That's what men always say when honor calls. That's what you tell your families, tell yourselves. You do have a choice. And you've made it. I can't do it, Ned. I really can't.",1,2
Eddard Stark, You can. You must.,1,2
Robb Stark, You've said goodbye to Bran? He's not going to die. I know it.,1,2
Jon Snow, You Starks are hard to kill.,1,2
Robb Stark, My mother?,1,2
Jon Snow, She was very kind.,1,2
Robb Stark," Good. Next time I see you, you'll be all in black.",1,2
Jon Snow, It was always my color.,1,2
Robb Stark," Farewell, Snow.",1,2
Jon Snow," And you, Stark.",1,2
Eddard Stark," There's great honor serving in the Night's Watch. The Starks have manned the Wall for thousands of years. And you are a Stark. You might not have my name, but you have my blood.",1,2
Jon Snow," Is my mother alive? Does she know about me? Where I am, where I'm going? Does she care?",1,2
Eddard Stark," The next time we see each other, we'll talk about your mother. I promise.",1,2
Robert Baratheon," Gods, this is country! I've half a mind to leave them all behind and keep going.",1,2
Eddard Stark, I've half a mind to go with you.,1,2
Robert Baratheon," What do you say, just you and me on the Kingsroad, swords at our sides, a couple of tavern wenches to warm our beds tonight.",1,2
Eddard Stark, You should have asked me 20 years ago.,1,2
Robert Baratheon," There were wars to fight, women to marry... We never had the chance to be young.",1,2
Eddard Stark, I recall a few chances.,1,2
Robert Baratheon," There was that one... Oh, what was her name? That common girl of yours? Becca? With the great big tits you could bury your face in.",1,2
Eddard Stark, Bessie. She was one of yours.,1,2
Robert Baratheon, Bessie! Thank the gods for Bessie and her tits. Yours was... Aleena? No. You told me once. Meryl? Your bastard's mother?,1,2
Eddard Stark, Wylla.,1,2
Robert Baratheon, That's it. She must have been a rare wench to make Lord Eddard Stark forget his honor. You never told me what she looked like.,1,2
Eddard Stark, Nor will I.,1,2
Robert Baratheon," We were at war. None of us knew if we were gonna go back home again. You're too hard on yourself. You always have been. I swear if I weren't your King, you'd have hit me already.",1,2
Eddard Stark, The worst thing about your coronation... I'll never get to hit you again.,1,2
Robert Baratheon," Trust me, that's not the worst thing. There was a rider in the night.",1,2
Eddard Stark, Daenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord. What of it? Should we send her a wedding gift?,1,2
Robert Baratheon," A knife perhaps, a good sharp one, and a bold man to wield it.",1,2
Eddard Stark, She's little more than a child.,1,2
Robert Baratheon, Soon enough that child will spread her legs and start breeding.,1,2
Eddard Stark, Tell me we're not speaking of this.,1,2
Robert Baratheon," Oh, it's unspeakable to you? What her father did to your family... That was unspeakable. What Rhaegar Targaryen did to your sister... the woman I loved. I'll kill every Targaryen I get my hands on.",1,2
Eddard Stark," But you can't get your hands on this one, can you?",1,2
Robert Baratheon," This Khal Drogo, it's said he has 100,000 men in his horde.",1,2
Eddard Stark," Even a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm, as long as they remain on the other side of the Narrow Sea. They have no ships, Robert.",1,2
Robert Baratheon," There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms who call me Usurper. If the Targaryen boy crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back, the scum will join him.",1,2
Eddard Stark," He will not cross. And if by chance he does, we'll throw him back into the sea.",1,2
Robert Baratheon," There's a war coming, Ned. I don't know when, I don't know who we'll be fighting, but it's coming.",1,2
Benjen Stark, Sit. You'll be fed. Untie them.,1,2
Tyrion Lannister, Rapers. They were given a choice no doubt... Castration or the Wall. Most choose the knife. Not impressed by your new brothers? Lovely thing about the Watch... You discard your old family and get a whole new one.,1,2
Jon Snow, Why do you read so much?,1,2
Tyrion Lannister, Look at me and tell me what you see.,1,2
Jon Snow, Is this a trick?,1,2
Tyrion Lannister," What you see is a dwarf. If I'd been born a peasant they might've left me out in the woods to die. Alas, I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock. Things are expected of me. My father was the Hand of the King for 20 years.",1,2
Jon Snow, Until your brother killed that King.,1,2
Tyrion Lannister," Yes, until my brother killed him. Life is full of these little ironies. My sister married the new King and my repulsive nephew will be King after him. I must do my part for the honor of my house, wouldn't you agree? But how? Well, my brother has his sword and I have my mind. And a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone. That's why I read so much. And you? What's your story, bastard?",1,2
Jon Snow," Ask me nicely and maybe I'll tell you, dwarf.",1,2
Tyrion Lannister," A bastard boy with nothing to inherit, off to join the ancient order of the Night's Watch, alongside his valiant brothers-in-arms.",1,2
Jon Snow, The Night's Watch protects the realm from...,1,2
Tyrion Lannister," Yes yes, against grumpkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about. You're a smart boy. You don't believe that nonsense... Everything's better with some wine in the belly.",1,2
Maester Luwin," It's time we reviewed the accounts, my lady. You'll want to know how much this royal visit has cost us.",1,2
Catelyn Stark, Talk to Poole about it.,1,2
Maester Luwin," Poole went south with Lord Stark, my lady. We need a new steward, and there are several other appointments that require our immediate attention...",1,2
Catelyn Stark, I don't care about appointments!,1,2
Robb Stark, I'll make the appointments. We'll talk about it first thing in the morning.,1,2
Maester Luwin," Very good, my Lord. My Lady.",1,2
Robb Stark, When was the last time you left this room?,1,2
Catelyn Stark, I have to take care of him.,1,2
Robb Stark," He's not going to die, mother. Maester Luwin says the most dangerous time has passed.",1,2
Catelyn Stark, What if he's wrong? Bran needs me.,1,2
Robb Stark," Rickon needs you. He's six. He doesn't know what's happening. He follows me around all day, clutching my leg, crying...",1,2
Catelyn Stark, Close the windows! I can't stand it! Please make them stop! (Wolf’s howling repeatedly),1,2
Robb Stark, Fire. You stay here. I'll come back.,1,2
Assassin, You're not supposed to be here. No one is supposed to be here. It's a mercy. He's dead already.,1,2
Catelyn Stark, No!,1,2
Daenerys Targaryen, Have you ever seen a dragon?,1,2
Irri," Dragon gone, Khaleesi.",1,2
Daenerys Targaryen, Everywhere? Even in the east?,1,2
Irri, No dragon. Brave men kill them. It is known.,1,2
Jhiqui, It is known.,1,2
Doreah, A trader from Garth told me that dragons come from the moon.,1,2
Daenerys Targaryen, The moon?,1,2
Doreah," He told me the moon was an egg, Khaleesi, that once there were two moons in the sky. But one wandered too close to the sun and it cracked from the heat. Out of it poured a thousand thousand dragons and they drank the sun's fire.",1,2
Irri, Moon is no egg. Moon is goddess... wife of sun. It is known.,1,2
Jhiqui, It is known.,1,2
Daenerys Targaryen, Leave me with her. Why did the trader from Garth tell you these stories?,1,2
Doreah," Men like to talk when they're happy. Before your brother bought me for you, it was my job to make men happy.",1,2
Daenerys Targaryen, How old were you?,1,2
Doreah, I was nine when my mother sold me to the pleasure house.,1,2
Daenerys Targaryen, Nine?!,1,2
Doreah," I did not touch a man for three years, Khaleesi. First you must learn.",1,2
Daenerys Targaryen, Can you teach me how to make the Khal happy?,1,2
Doreah, Yes.,1,2
Daenerys Targaryen, Will it take three years?,1,2
Doreah, No.,1,2
Benjen Stark, Welcome.,1,2
Catelyn Stark, What I am about to tell you must remain between us. I don't think Bran fell from that tower. I think he was thrown.,1,2
Maester Luwin, The boy was always sure-footed before.,1,2
Catelyn Stark, Someone tried to kill him twice. Why? Why murder an innocent child? Unless he saw something he wasn't meant to see.,1,2
Theon Greyjoy," Saw what, my lady?",1,2
Catelyn Stark, I don't know. But I would stake my life the Lannisters are involved. We already have reason to suspect their loyalty to the crown.,1,2
Rodrick Cassel," Did you notice the dagger the killer used? It's too fine a weapon for such a man. The blade is Valyrian steel, the handle dragonbone. Someone gave it to him.",1,2
Robb Stark, They come into our home and try to murder my brother? If it's war they want...,1,2
Theon Greyjoy," If it comes to that, you know I'll stand behind you.",1,2
Maester Luwin," What, is there going to be a battle in the Godswood? Too easily words of war become acts of war. We don't know the truth yet. Lord Stark must be told of this.",1,2
Catelyn Stark, I don't trust a raven to carry these words.,1,2
Robb Stark, I'll ride to King's Landing.,1,2
Catelyn Stark, No. There must always be a Stark in Winterfell. I will go myself.,1,2
Robb Stark," Mother, you can't.",1,2
Catelyn Stark, I must.,1,2
Rodrick Cassel, I'll send Hal with a squad of guardsmen to escort you.,1,2
Catelyn Stark, Too large a party attracts unwanted attention. I don't want the Lannisters to know I'm coming.,1,2
Rodrick Cassel, Let me accompany you at least. The Kingsroad can be a dangerous place for a woman alone.,1,2
Robb Stark, What about Bran?,1,2
Catelyn Stark, I have prayed to the Seven for more than a month. Bran's life is in their hands now.,1,2
Doreah," No, Khaleesi. You must look in his eyes always. Love comes in at the eyes. It is said that Irogenia of Lys could finish a man with nothing but her eyes.",1,2
Daenerys Targaryen, Finish a man?,1,2
Doreah, Kings traveled across the world for a night with Irogenia. Magisters sold their palaces. Khals burned her enemies just to have her for a few hours. They say a thousand men proposed to her and she refused them all.,1,2
Daenerys Targaryen," Well, she sounds like an interesting woman. I don't think that Drogo will like it with me on top.",1,2
Doreah," You will make him like it, Khaleesi. Men want what they've never had. And the Dothraki take slaves like a hound takes a bitch. Are you a slave, Khaleesi? Then don't make love like a slave. Very good, Khaleesi. Out there he is the mighty Khal, but in this tent, he belongs to you.",1,2
Daenerys Targaryen, I don't think that this is the Dothraki way.,1,2
Doreah," If he wanted the Dothraki way, why did he marry you?",1,2
Daenerys Targaryen, No. No. Tonight I would look upon your face.,1,2
Sansa Stark," Pardon me, Ser.",1,2
Sandor Clegane," Do I frighten you so much, girl? Or is it him there making you shake? He frightens me too. Look at that face.",1,2
Sansa Stark," I'm sorry if I offended you, Ser. Why won't he speak to me?",1,2
Sandor Clegane, He hasn't been very talkative these last 20 years. Since the mad King had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers.,1,2
Joffrey Baratheon," He speaks damn well with his sword though. Ser Ilyn Payne, the King's justice. The royal executioner. What is it, sweet lady? Does the hound frighten you? Away with you, dog. You're scaring my lady. I don't like to see you upset. The sun is finally shining. Come walk with me.",1,2
Sansa Stark," Stay, Lady. I probably shouldn't have any more. Father only lets us have one cup at feasts.",1,2
Joffrey Baratheon, My princess can drink as much as she wants. Don't worry... You're safe with me.,1,2
Mycah, I'll get you!,1,2
Sansa Stark, Arya!,1,2
Arya Stark, What are you doing here? Go away.,1,2
Joffrey Baratheon," Your sister? And who are you, boy?",1,2
Mycah," Mycah, my Lord.",1,2
Sansa Stark, He the butcher's boy.,1,2
Arya Stark, He's my friend.,1,2
Joffrey Baratheon," A butcher's boy who wants to be a Knight, eh? Pick up your sword, butcher's boy. Let's see how good you are.",1,2
Mycah," She asked me to, my Lord. She asked me to.",1,2
Joffrey Baratheon," I'm your prince, not your lord, and I said pick up your sword.",1,2
Mycah," It's not a sword, my prince. It's only a stick.",1,2
Joffrey Baratheon," And you're not a Knight. Only a butcher's boy. That was my lady's sister you were hitting, do you know that?",1,2
Arya Stark, Stop it!,1,2
Sansa Stark," Arya, stay out of this.",1,2
Joffrey Baratheon, I won't hurt him... Much. Filthy little bitch!,1,2
Sansa Stark," No no, stop it, stop it, both of you. You're spoiling it. You're spoiling everything!",1,2
Joffrey Baratheon," I'll gut you, you little cunt!",1,2
Sansa Stark, Arya!,1,2
Arya Stark, Nymeria!,1,2
Joffrey Baratheon, Please don't.,1,2
Sansa Stark," Arya, leave him alone. My prince, my poor prince, look what they did to you. Stay here, I'll go back to the inn and bring help.",1,2
Joffrey Baratheon, Then go! Don't touch me.,1,2
Soldier 1, The wolf's not here. Look down by the stream.,1,2
Arya Stark, You've got to go. They'll kill you for what you did to Joffrey. Go on... run. Go! Leave now!,1,2
Soldier 2, It's a direwolf.,1,2
Soldier 1, I'll check down here.,1,2
Soldier 2, I think I heard a noise.,1,2
Arya Stark, Go!,1,2
Jory Cassel, My lord! My lord! They found her. She's unharmed.,1,2
Eddard Stark, Where is she?,1,2
Jory Cassel, She's been taken directly before the King.,1,2
Eddard Stark, Who took her?,1,2
Jory Cassel, The Lannisters found her.,1,2
Eddard Stark," Right, get back.",1,2
Jory Cassel, The Queen ordered them to bring her straight to him.,1,2
Eddard Stark, Back! Back to the inn. All back!,1,2
Arya Stark, I'm sorry.,1,2
Eddard Stark, Are you hurt?,1,2
Arya Stark, No.,1,2
Eddard Stark, It's all right. What is the meaning of this? Why was my daughter not brought to me at once?,1,2
Cersei Baratheon, How dare you speak to your King in that manner?,1,2
Robert Baratheon," Quiet, woman. Sorry, Ned. I never meant to frighten the girl. But we need to get this business done quickly.",1,2
Cersei Baratheon, Your girl and that butcher's boy attacked my son. That animal of hers nearly tore his arm off.,1,2
Arya Stark, That's not true! She just... Bit him a little. He was hurting Mycah.,1,2
Cersei Baratheon, Joffrey told us what happened. You and that boy beat him with clubs while you set your wolf on him.,1,2
Arya Stark, That's not what happened!,1,2
Joffrey Baratheon, Yes it is! They all attacked me and she threw my sword in the river.,1,2
Arya Stark, Liar!,1,2
Joffrey Baratheon, Shut up!,1,2
Robert Baratheon," Enough! He tells me one thing, she tells me another. Seven hells! What am I to make of this? Where's your other daughter, Ned?",1,2
Eddard Stark, In bed asleep.,1,2
Cersei Baratheon," She's not. Sansa, come here, darling.",1,2
Robert Baratheon," Now, child... Tell me what happened. Tell it all and tell it true. It's a great crime to lie to a King.",1,2
Sansa Stark, I don't know. I don't remember. Everything happened so fast. I didn't see.,1,2
Arya Stark, Liar! Liar liar liar!,1,2
Sansa Stark, Arya!,1,2
Eddard Stark, Stop it! That's enough of that.,1,2
Arya Stark, Liar liar liar!,1,2
Eddard Stark, Stop! Arya!,1,2
Cersei Baratheon, She's as wild as that animal of hers. I want her punished.,1,2
Robert Baratheon," What would you have me do, whip her through the streets? Damn it, children fight. It's over.",1,2
Cersei Baratheon, Joffrey will bear these scars for the rest of his life.,1,2
Robert Baratheon, You let that little girl disarm you? See to it that your daughter is disciplined. I'll do the same with my son.,1,2
Eddard Stark," Gladly, your Grace.",1,2
Cersei Baratheon, And what of the direwolf? What of the beast that savaged your son?,1,2
Robert Baratheon, I'd forgot the damned wolf.,1,2
Soldier," We found no trace of the direwolf, your Grace.",1,2
Robert Baratheon, So be it.,1,2
Cersei Baratheon, We have another wolf.,1,2
Robert Baratheon, As you will.,1,2
Eddard Stark, You can't mean it.,1,2
Robert Baratheon, A direwolf's no pet. Get her a dog. She'll be happier for it.,1,2
Sansa Stark," He doesn't mean Lady, does he? No no, not Lady! Lady didn't bite anyone! She's good!",1,2
Arya Stark, Lady wasn't there! You leave her alone!,1,2
Sansa Stark, Stop them. Don't let them do it. Please! It wasn't Lady!,1,2
Eddard Stark, s this your command... your Grace?,1,2
Cersei Baratheon, Where is the beast?,1,2
Soldier," Chained up outside, your Grace.",1,2
Cersei Baratheon," Ser Ilyn, do me the honor.",1,2
Eddard Stark," No. Jory... Take the girls to their rooms. If it must be done, then I'll do it myself.",1,2
Cersei Baratheon, Is this some trick?,1,2
Eddard Stark, The wolf is of the north. She deserves better than a butcher.,1,2
Eddard Stark, The butcher's boy... You rode him down?,1,2
Sandor Clegane, He ran... Not very fast.,1,2
King’s Landing Guard," Welcome, Lord Stark. Grand Maester Pycelle has called a meeting of the Small Council. The honor of your presence is requested.",1,3
Eddard Stark," Get the girls settled in. I'll be back in time for supper. And, Jory, you go with them.",1,3
Jory Cassel," Yes, my Lord.",1,3
King’s Landing Guard, If you'd like to change into something more appropriate…,1,3
Jaime Lannister," Thank the gods you're here, Stark. About time we had some stern northern leadership.",1,3
Eddard Stark, Glad to see you're protecting the throne.,1,3
Jaime Lannister," Sturdy old thing. How many kings' asses have polished it, I wonder? What's the line? The King shits and the Hand wipes.",1,3
Eddard Stark, Very handsome armor. Not a scratch on it.,1,3
Jaime Lannister," I know. People have been swinging at me for years, but they always seem to miss.",1,3
Eddard Stark, You've chosen your opponents wisely then.,1,3
Jaime Lannister," I have a knack for it. It must be strange for you coming into this room. I was standing right here when it happened. He was very brave, your brother. Your father too. They didn't deserve to die like that. Nobody deserves to die like that.",1,3
Eddard Stark, But you just stood there and watched.,1,3
Jaime Lannister," 500 men just stood there and watched. All the great knights of the Seven Kingdoms. You think anyone said a word, lifted a finger? No, Lord Stark. 500 men and this room was silent as a crypt. Except for the screams, of course, and the Mad King laughing. And later... When I watched the Mad King die, I remembered him laughing as your father burned... It felt like justice.",1,3
Eddard Stark, Is that what you tell yourself at night? You're a servant of justice? That you were avenging my father when you shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryen's back?,1,3
Jaime Lannister," Tell me... If I'd stabbed the Mad King in the belly instead of the back, would you admire me more?",1,3
Eddard Stark," You served him well, when serving was safe.",1,3
Varys, Lord Stark.,1,3
Eddard Stark, Lord Varys.,1,3
Varys, I was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles on the Kingsroad. We are all praying for Prince Joffrey's full recovery.,1,3
Eddard Stark, A shame you didn't say a prayer for the butcher's son. Renly! You're looking well.,1,3
Renly Baratheon," And you look tired from the road. I told them this meeting could wait another day, but...",1,3
Petyr Baelish," But we have a Kingdom to look after. I've hoped to meet you for some time, Lord Stark. No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me.",1,3
Eddard Stark," She has, Lord Baelish. I understand you knew my brother Brandon as well.",1,3
Petyr Baelish, All too well. I still carry a token of his esteem from navel to collarbone.,1,3
Eddard Stark, Perhaps you chose the wrong man to duel with.,1,3
Petyr Baelish," It wasn't the man that I chose, my Lord. It was Catelyn Tully. A woman worth fighting for, I'm sure you'll agree.",1,3
Grand Maester Pycelle," I humbly beg your pardon, my Lord Stark.",1,3
Eddard Stark, Grand Maester.,1,3
Grand Maester Pycelle, How many years has it been? You were a young man.,1,3
Eddard Stark, And you served another King.,1,3
Grand Maester Pycelle," How forgetful of me. This belongs to you, now. Should we begin?",1,3
Eddard Stark, Without the King?,1,3
Renly Baratheon," Winter may be coming, but I'm afraid the same cannot be said for my brother.",1,3
Varys, His Grace has many cares. He entrusts some small matters to us that we might lighten the load.,1,3
Petyr Baelish, We are the lords of small matters here.,1,3
Renly Baratheon, My brother instructs us to stage a tournament in honor of Lord Stark's appointment as Hand of the King.,1,3
Petyr Baelish," Mmm, how much?",1,3
Eddard Stark," 40,000 gold dragons to the champion, 20,000 to the runner-up, 20,000 to the winning archer.",1,3
Grand Maester Pycelle, Can the treasury bear such expense?,1,3
Petyr Baelish," I'll have to borrow it. The Lannisters will accommodate, I expect. We already owe Lord Tywin 3 million gold. What's another 80,000?",1,3
Eddard Stark, Are you telling me the Crown is three million in debt?,1,3
Petyr Baelish, I'm telling you the Crown is six million in debt.,1,3
Eddard Stark, How could you let this happen?,1,3
Petyr Baelish, The Master of Coin finds the money. The King and the Hand spend it.,1,3
Eddard Stark, I will not believe Jon Arryn allowed Robert to bankrupt the realm.,1,3
Grand Maester Pycelle," Lord Arryn gave wise and prudent advice, but I fear His Grace doesn't always listen.",1,3
Renly Baratheon," ""Counting coppers,"" he calls it.",1,3
Eddard Stark, I'll speak to him tomorrow. This tournament is an extravagance we cannot afford.,1,3
Petyr Baelish," As you will. But still, we'd best make our plans.",1,3
Eddard Stark," There will be no plans until I speak to Robert. Forgive me, my Lords. I had a long ride.",1,3
Varys," You are the King's Hand, Lord Stark, we serve at your pleasure.",1,3
Cersei Baratheon," Please, it's nearly healed.",1,3
Joffrey Baratheon, It's ugly.,1,3
Cersei Baratheon," A King should have scars, you fought off a direwolf. You're a warrior like your father.",1,3
Joffrey Baratheon," I'm not like him. I didn't fight off anything. It bit me and all I did was scream. And the two Stark girls saw it, both of them.",1,3
Cersei Baratheon," That's not true. You killed the beast. You only spared the girl because of the love your father bears her father. When Aerys Targaryen sat on the Iron Throne, your father was a rebel and a traitor. Someday you'll sit on the throne and the truth will be what you make it.",1,3
Joffrey Baratheon, Do I have to marry her?,1,3
Cersei Baratheon," Yes. She's very beautiful and young. If you don't like her, you only need to see her on formal occasions and when the time comes, to make little princes and princesses. And if you'd rather fuck painted whores, you'll fuck painted whores. And if you'd rather lie with noble virgins, so be it. You are my darling boy and the world will be exactly as you want it to be. Do something nice for the Stark girl.",1,3
Joffrey Baratheon, I don't want to.,1,3
Cersei Baratheon," No, but you will. The occasional kindness will spare you all sorts of trouble down the road.",1,3
Joffrey Baratheon, We allow the northerners too much power. They consider themselves our equals.,1,3
Cersei Baratheon, How would you handle them?,1,3
Joffrey Baratheon," I'd double their taxes and command them to supply 10,000 men to the royal army.",1,3
Cersei Baratheon, A royal army?,1,3
Joffrey Baratheon," Why should every lord command his own men? It's primitive, no better than the hill tribes. We should have a standing army of men loyal to the Crown, trained by experienced soldiers... Instead of a mob of peasants who've never held pikes in their lives.",1,3
Cersei Baratheon, And if the northerners rebel?,1,3
Joffrey Baratheon," I'd crush them. Seize Winterfell and install someone loyal to the realm as Warden of the North. Uncle Kevan, maybe.",1,3
Cersei Baratheon," And these 10,000 northern troops, would they fight for you or their lord?",1,3
Joffrey Baratheon, For me. I'm their King.,1,3
Cersei Baratheon," But you've just invaded their homeland, asked them to kill their brothers.",1,3
Joffrey Baratheon, I'm not asking.,1,3
Cersei Baratheon," The North cannot be held... not by an outsider. It's too big and too wild. When the winter comes, the Seven gods together couldn't save you and your royal army. A good King knows when to save his strength... And when to destroy his enemies.",1,3
Joffrey Baratheon, So you agree... The Starks are enemies?,1,3
Cersei Baratheon, Everyone who isn't us is an enemy.,1,3
Septa Mordane," Enough of that, young lady. Eat your food.",1,3
Arya Stark, I'm practicing.,1,3
Sansa Stark, Practicing for what?,1,3
Arya Stark, The Prince.,1,3
Septa Mordane," Arya, stop!",1,3
Arya Stark, He's a liar and a coward and he killed my friend.,1,3
Sansa Stark, The Hound killed your friend.,1,3
Arya Stark, The Hound does whatever the Prince tells him to do.,1,3
Sansa Stark, You're an idiot.,1,3
Arya Stark," You're a liar. And if you told the truth, Mycah would be alive.",1,3
Septa Mordane, Enough!,1,3
Eddard Stark, What's happening here?,1,3
Septa Mordane, Arya would rather act like a beast than a lady.,1,3
Eddard Stark," Go to your room. We'll speak later. That's for you, love…",1,3
Eddard Stark, The same dollmaker makes all of Princess Myrcella's toys. Don't you like it?,1,3
Sansa Stark, I haven't played with dolls since I was eight. May I be excused?,1,3
Septa Mordane, You've barely eaten a thing.,1,3
Eddard Stark, It's all right. Go on.,1,3
Eddard Stark, War was easier than daughters.,1,3
Arya Stark, Go away!,1,3
Eddard Stark," Arya, open the door. May I come in? Whose sword is that?",1,3
Arya Stark, Mine.,1,3
Eddard Stark, Give it to me. I know this maker's mark. This is Mikken's work. Where did you get this? This is no toy. Little ladies shouldn't play with swords.,1,3
Arya Stark, I wasn't playing. And I don't want to be a lady.,1,3
Eddard Stark, Come here. Now what do you want with this?,1,3
Arya Stark, It's called Needle.,1,3
Eddard Stark, A blade with a name. And who were you hoping to skewer with Needle? Your sister? Do you know the first thing about sword fighting?,1,3
Arya Stark, Stick 'em with the pointy end.,1,3
Eddard Stark, [laughs] That's the essence of it.,1,3
Arya Stark, I was trying to learn. I asked Mycah to practice with me. I asked him. It was my fault.,1,3
Eddard Stark," No, sweet girl. You didn't kill the butcher's boy.",1,3
Arya Stark," I hate them! I hate all of them. The Hound, the Queen and the King and Joffrey and Sansa.",1,3
Eddard Stark, Sansa was dragged before the King and Queen... And asked to call the Prince a liar.,1,3
Arya Stark, So was I! He is a liar.,1,3
Eddard Stark," Darling, listen to me. Sansa will be married to Joffrey someday. She cannot betray him. She must take his side even when he's wrong.",1,3
Arya Stark, But how you can let her marry someone like that?,1,3
Eddard Stark, Well… Look at me. You're a Stark of Winterfell. You know our words.,1,3
Arya Stark, Winter is coming.,1,3
Eddard Stark," You were born in the long summer. You've never known anything else. But now winter is truly coming. And in the winter, we must protect ourselves, look after one another. Sansa is your sister.",1,3
Arya Stark, I don't hate her. Not really.,1,3
Eddard Stark," I don't want to frighten you, but I won't lie to you either. We've come to a dangerous place. We cannot fight a war amongst ourselves. All right? Go on. It's yours.",1,3
Arya Stark, I can keep it?,1,3
Eddard Stark," Try not to stab your sister with it. If you're going to own a sword, you'd better know how to use it.",1,3
Old Nan, Don't listen to it. Crows are all liars. I know a story about a crow.,1,3
Bran Stark, I hate your stories.,1,3
Old Nan, I know a story about a boy who hated stories. I could tell you about Ser Duncan the Tall. Those were always your favorites.,1,3
Bran Stark, Those weren't my favorites. My favorites were the scary ones.,1,3
Old Nan," Oh, my sweet summer child. What do you know about fear? Fear is for the winter, when the snows fall a hundred feet deep. Fear is for the long night, when the sun hides for years and children are born and live and die all in darkness. That is the time for fear, my little Lord, when the White Walkers move through the woods. Thousands of years ago there came a night that lasted a generation. Kings froze to death in their castles, same as the shepherds in their huts. And women smothered their babies rather than see them starve, and wept and felt the tears freeze on their cheeks. So is this the sort of story that you like? In that darkness, the White Walkers came for the first time. They swept through cities and kingdoms, riding their dead horses, hunting with their packs of pale spiders big as hounds…",1,3
Robb Stark, What are you telling him now?,1,3
Old Nan, Only what the little Lord wants to hear.,1,3
Robb Stark, Get your supper. I want some time with him. One time she told me the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant named Macumber.,1,3
Bran Stark, Maybe we do.,1,3
Robb Stark," How do you feel? You still don't remember anything? I've seen you climb a thousand times. In the wind, in the rain... A thousand times. You never fall.",1,3
Bran Stark," I did though. It's true, isn't it... what Maester Luwin says about my legs? I'd rather be dead.",1,3
Robb Stark, Don't ever say that.,1,3
Bran Stark, I'd rather be dead.,1,3
Rodrick Cassel," Fewer eyes back here, my Lady. But still too many.",1,3
Catelyn Stark, It's nine years since I've set foot in the capital. And no one knew who I was the last time I came either.,1,3
Rodrick Cassel, My Lady.,1,3
Guard," Welcome to King's Landing, Lady Stark. Would you mind following us?",1,3
Catelyn Stark, I would. We've done nothing wrong.,1,3
Guard, We've been instructed to escort you into the city.,1,3
Catelyn Stark," Instructed? I don't know who's providing your instructions, but...",1,3
Guard," Follow me, Lady Stark.",1,3
Petyr Baelish, Cat! Go on. Go upstairs. (to his whores),1,3
Catelyn Stark, You little worm! You take me for some back-alley Sally you can drag into a…,1,3
Petyr Baelish, I meant no disrespect to you of all people.,1,3
Catelyn Stark, How dare you bring me here! Have you lost your mind?,1,3
Petyr Baelish, No one will come looking for you here. Isn't that what like you wanted? I'm truly sorry... about the locale.,1,3
Catelyn Stark, How did you know I was coming to King's Landing?,1,3
Petyr Baelish, A dear friend told me.,1,3
Varys, Lady Stark.,1,3
Catelyn Stark, Lord Varys.,1,3
Varys, To see you again after so many years is a blessing. Your poor hands.,1,3
Catelyn Stark, How did you know I was coming?,1,3
Varys," Knowledge is my trade, my Lady. Did you bring the dagger with you, by any chance? My little birds are everywhere. Even in the north. They whisper to me the strangest stories. Valyrian steel.",1,3
Catelyn Stark, Do you know whose dagger this is?,1,3
Varys, I must admit I do not.,1,3
Petyr Baelish," Well well, this is an historic day. Something you don't know that I do. There's only one dagger like this in all of the Seven Kingdoms. It's mine.",1,3
Catelyn Stark, Yours?,1,3
Petyr Baelish," At least it was, until the tournament on Prince Joffrey's last nameday. I bet on Ser Jaime in the jousting, as any sane man would. When the Knight of the Flowers unseated him, I lost this dagger.",1,3
Catelyn Stark, To whom?,1,3
Petyr Baelish, Tyrion Lannister. The Imp.,1,3
Alliser Thorne," If that were a real sword, you'd be dead. Lord Snow here grew up in a castle spitting down on the likes of you. Pyp. Do you think Ned Stark's bastard bleeds like the rest of us?",1,3
Alliser Thorne, Next!,1,3
Alliser Thorne, Next!,1,3
Alliser Thorne," Lord Snow, it appears you're the least useless person here. Go clean yourselves up. There's only so much I can stomach in a day.",1,3
Tyrion Lannister, A charming man.,1,3
Jeor Mormont, I don't need him to be charming. I need him to turn this bunch of thieves and runaways into men of the Night's Watch.,1,3
Tyrion Lannister," And how's that going, Commander Mormont?",1,3
Jeor Mormont, Slowly. A raven came for Ned Stark's son.,1,3
Tyrion Lannister, Good news or bad?,1,3
Jeor Mormont, Both.,1,3
Grand Maester Pycelle, Lord Stark. I meant to give you this earlier. So forgetful these days. A raven from Winterfell this morning.,1,3
Petyr Baelish, Good news? Perhaps you'd like to share it with your wife?,1,3
Eddard Stark, My wife is in Winterfell.,1,3
Petyr Baelish, Is she?,1,3
Petyr Baelish, I thought that she'd be safest in here. One of several such establishments I own.,1,3
Eddard Stark, You're a funny man. A very funny man.,1,3
Catelyn Stark, Ned! [poking her head out of a window],1,3
Petyr Baelish," The Starks... Quick tempers, slow minds.",1,3
Grenn," You broke my nose, bastard!",1,3
Jon Snow, It's an improvement.,1,3
Grenn," If we threw you over the Wall, wonder how long it'd take you to hit.",1,3
Pyp, I wonder if they'd find you before the wolves did.,1,3
Grenn," What're you looking at, halfman?",1,3
Tyrion Lannister, I'm looking at you. You've got an interesting face. Very distinctive faces. All of you.,1,3
Rast, What do you care about our faces?,1,3
Tyrion Lannister," It's just I think they would look marvelous decorating spikes in King's Landing. Perhaps I'll write my sister, the Queen, about it.",1,3
Grenn," We'll talk later, Lord Snow.",1,3
Jon Snow, Everybody knew what this place was and no one told me. No one but you. My father knew and left me to rot here at the Wall all the same.,1,3
Tyrion Lannister, Grenn's father left him too... Outside a farmhouse when he was three. Pyp was caught stealing a wheel of cheese. His little sister hadn't eaten in three days. He was given a choice: his right hand or the Wall. I've been asking the Lord Commander about them. Fascinating stories.,1,3

He was given a choice: his right hand or the Wall. I've been asking the Lord Commander about them. Fascinating stories.,1,3
Jon Snow, They hate me because I'm better than they are.,1,3
Tyrion Lannister, It's a lucky thing none of them were trained by a master-at-arms like your Ser Rodrik. I don't imagine any of them have ever held a real sword before they came here. Your brother Bran. He's woken up.,1,3
Petyr Baelish, The mere suggestion that the Queen's brother tried to kill your boy would be considered treason.,1,3
Catelyn Stark, We have proof. We have the blade.,1,3
Petyr Baelish," Which Lord Tyrion will say was stolen from him. The only man who could say otherwise has no throat, thanks to your boy's wolf.",1,3
Catelyn Stark, Petyr has promised to help us find the truth. He's like a little brother to me. He would never betray my trust.,1,3
Petyr Baelish," I'll try to keep you alive, for her sake. A fool's task, admittedly, but I've never been able to refuse your wife anything.",1,3
Catelyn Stark, I won't forget this. You're a true friend.,1,3
Petyr Baelish, Don't tell anyone. I have a reputation to maintain.,1,3
Cersei Baratheon, How could you be so stupid?,1,3
Jaime Lannister, Calm down.,1,3
Cersei Baratheon, He's a child... 10 years old. What were you thinking?,1,3
Jaime Lannister, I was thinking of us. You're a bit late to start complaining about it now. What has the boy told them?,1,3
Cersei Baratheon, Nothing. He's said nothing. He remembers nothing.,1,3
Jaime Lannister, Then what are you raving about?,1,3
Cersei Baratheon, What if it comes back to him? If he tells his father what he saw...,1,3
Jaime Lannister, We'll say he was lying. We'll say he was dreaming. We'll say whatever we like. I think we can outfox a 10-year-old.,1,3
Cersei Baratheon, And my husband?,1,3
Jaime Lannister," I'll go to war with him if I have to. They can write a ballad about us : ""The War for Cersei's Cunt.""",1,3
Jaime Lannister," I'll go to war with him if I have to. They can write a ballad about us : ""The War for Cersei's Cunt.""",1,3
Cersei Baratheon, Let me go.,1,3
Jaime Lannister, Never.,1,3
Cersei Baratheon, Let me go.,1,3
Jaime Lannister," The boy won't talk. And if he does, I'll kill him. Him, Ned Stark, the King... the whole bloody lot of them, until you and I are the only people left in this world.",1,3
Catelyn Stark, I wish I could see the girls.,1,3
Eddard Stark, It's too dangerous.,1,3
Catelyn Stark, Just for a moment.,1,3
Eddard Stark, Until we know who our enemies are...,1,3
Catelyn Stark," I know they did it, Ned. The Lannisters. In my bones, I know it.",1,3
Eddard Stark, Littlefinger's right. I can't do anything without proof.,1,3
Cersei Baratheon, And if you find the proof?,1,3
Eddard Stark," Then I bring it to Robert... And hope he's still the man I once knew. You watch yourself on the road, huh? That temper of yours is a dangerous thing.",1,3
Catelyn Stark," My temper? Gods be good, you nearly killed poor Littlefinger yesterday.",1,3
Eddard Stark, He still loves you.,1,3
Catelyn Stark, Does he?,1,3
Eddard Stark, Off with you.,1,3
Robert Baratheon, It's been a long time. But I still remember every face. You remember your first?,1,3
Barristan Selmy," Of course, your Grace.",1,3
Robert Baratheon, Who was it?,1,3
Barristan Selmy, A Tyroshi. Never learned the name.,1,3
Robert Baratheon, How'd you do it?,1,3
Barristan Selmy, Lance through the heart.,1,3
Robert Baratheon," Quick one. Lucky for you. Mine was some Tarly boy at the Battle of Summerhall. My horse took an arrow so I was on foot, slogging through the mud. He came running at me, this dumb high-born lad, thinking he could end the rebellion with the single swing of his sword. I knocked him down with the hammer. Gods, I was strong then. Caved in his breastplate. Probably shattered every rib he had. Stood over him, hammer in the air. Right before I brought it down he shouted, ""Wait! Wait!""... They never tell you how they all shit themselves. They don't put that part in the songs. Stupid boy. Now the Tarlys bend the knee like everyone else. He could have lingered on the edge of the battle with the smart boys and today his wife would be making him miserable, his sons would be ingrates, and he'd be waking three times in the night to piss into a bowl. Wine! Lancel. Gods, what a stupid name. Lancel Lannister. Who named you? Some halfwit with a stutter? What are you doing?",1,3
Lancel Lannister," It's empty, your Grace.",1,3
Robert Baratheon, What do you mean it's empty?,1,3
Lancel Lannister, There's no more wine.,1,3
Robert Baratheon," Is that what empty means?! So get more. Tell your cousin to get in here. Kingslayer! Get in here. Surrounded by Lannisters. Every time I close my eyes I see their blond hair and their smug, satisfied faces. It must wound your pride, huh? Standing out there like a glorified sentry. Jaime Lannister, son of the mighty Tywin... Forced to mind the door while your King eats and drinks and shits and fucks. So come on. We're telling war stories. Who was your first kill, not counting old men?",1,3
Jaime Lannister, One of the outlaws in the Brotherhood.,1,3
Barristan Selmy," I was there that day. You were only a squire, 16 years old.",1,3
Jaime Lannister, You killed Simon Toyne with a counter riposte. Best move I ever saw.,1,3
Barristan Selmy," A good fighter, Toyne, but he lacked stamina.",1,3
Robert Baratheon, Your outlaw... Any last words?,1,3
Jaime Lannister," I cut his head off, so no.",1,3
Robert Baratheon, What about Aerys Targaryen? What did the Mad King say when you stabbed him in the back? I never asked. Did he call you a traitor? Did he plead for a reprieve?,1,3
Jaime Lannister," He said the same thing he'd been saying for hours... ""Burn them all."" If that's all, your Grace...",1,3
Daenerys Targaryen, : Do the Dothrakis buy their slaves?,1,3
Daenerys Targaryen, : Do the Dothrakis buy their slaves?,1,3
Jorah Mormont, The Dothraki don't believe in money. Most of their slaves were given to them as gifts.,1,3
Daenerys Targaryen, From whom?,1,3
Jorah Mormont," If you rule a city and you see the horde approaching, you have two choices : pay tribute or fight. An easy choice for most. Of course, sometimes it's not enough. Sometimes a Khal feels insulted by the number of slaves he's given. He might think the men too weak or the women too ugly. Sometimes a Khal decides his riders haven't had a good fight in months and need the practice.",1,3
Jorah Mormont," If you rule a city and you see the horde approaching, you have two choices : pay tribute or fight. An easy choice for most. Of course, sometimes it's not enough. Sometimes a Khal feels insulted by the number of slaves he's given. He might think the men too weak or the women too ugly. Sometimes a Khal decides his riders haven't had a good fight in months and need the practice.",1,3
Daenerys Targaryen, Tell them all to stop.,1,3
Jorah Mormont, You want the entire horde to stop? For how long?,1,3
Daenerys Targaryen, Until I command them otherwise.,1,3
Jorah Mormont, You're learning to talk like a Queen.,1,3
Daenerys Targaryen, Not a Queen. A Khaleesi.,1,3
Viserys Targaryen, You dare! You give commands to me? To me? You do not command the dragon. I am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. I don't take orders from savages or their sluts. Do you hear me?,1,3
Irri," Rakharo ask if you want him dead, Khaleesi.",1,3
Daenerys Targaryen, No!,1,3
Irri," Rakharo say you should take ear, to teach respect.",1,3
Daenerys Targaryen," Please please, don't hurt him. Tell him I don't want my brother harmed.",1,3
Viserys Targaryen, Kill these Dothraki dogs! I am your King!,1,3
Jorah Mormont," Shall we return to the Khalasar, Khaleesi?",1,3
Rakharo, You walk. [to Viserys],1,3
Benjen Stark, I wanted to be here when you saw it for the first time. I'm leaving this morning.,1,3
Jon Snow, You're leaving?,1,3
Benjen Stark, I'm the First Ranger. My job is out there. There have been disturbing reports.,1,3
Jon Snow, What kind of reports?,1,3
Benjen Stark, The kind I don't want to believe.,1,3
Jon Snow, 'm ready. I won't let you down.,1,3
Benjen Stark," You're not going. You're no ranger, Jon.",1,3
Jon Snow, But I'm better than every...,1,3
Benjen Stark," Better than no one! Here... A man gets what he earns, when he earns it. We'll speak when I return.",1,3
Yoren, A bear's balls.,1,3
Tyrion Lannister, You're joking?,1,3
Yoren," And his brains and his guts, his lungs and his heart all fried in his own fat. When you're a hundred miles north of the Wall and you ate your last meal a week ago, you leave nothing for the wolves.",1,3
Tyrion Lannister, And how do a bear's balls taste?,1,3
Yoren," A bit chewy. And what about you, my Lord? What's the strangest thing you've eaten?",1,3
Tyrion Lannister," Do Dornish girls count? So you roam the Seven Kingdoms, collaring pickpockets and horse thieves and bringing them here as eager recruits?",1,3
Yoren, But it's not all of 'em's done bad things. Some of 'em's just poor lads looking for steady feed. Some of 'em's high-born lads looking for glory.,1,3
Tyrion Lannister, They have a better chance finding feed than glory.,1,3
Benjen Stark," The Night's Watch is a joke to you, is it? Is that what we are, Lannister? An army of jesters in black?",1,3
Tyrion Lannister," You don't have enough men to be an army and aside from Yoren here, none of you are particularly funny.",1,3
Benjen Stark," I hope we've provided you with some good stories to tell when you're back in King's Landing. But something to think about while you're drinking your wine down there, enjoying your brothels... Half the boys you've seen training will die north of the Wall. Might be a wilding's axe that gets them, might be sickness, might just be the cold. They die in pain. And they do it so plump little lords like you can enjoy their summer afternoons in peace and comfort.",1,3
Tyrion Lannister," Do you think I'm plump? Listen, Benjen... May I call you Benjen?",1,3
Benjen Stark, Call me what you like.,1,3
Tyrion Lannister, I'm not sure what I've done to offend you. I have great admiration for the Night's Watch. I've great admiration for you as First Ranger.,1,3
Benjen Stark," You know, my brother once told me that nothing someone says before the word ""but"" really counts.",1,3
Tyrion Lannister," But... I don't believe that giants and ghouls and White Walkers are lurking beyond the Wall. I believe that the only difference between us and the wildlings is that when the Wall went up, our ancestors happened to live on the right side of it.",1,3
Benjen Stark," You're right. The wildlings are no different from us. A little rougher maybe. But they're made of meat and bone. I know how to track them and I know how to kill them. It's not the wildlings giving me sleepless nights. You've never been north of the Wall, so don't tell me what's out there.",1,3
Yoren," Are you going below? Keep well, keep warm.",1,3
Benjen Stark," Enjoy the capital, brother.",1,3
Yoren, I always do.,1,3
Tyrion Lannister," I think he's starting to like me. ""Going below""?",1,3
Yoren, Into the tunnel and out the other side. He'll be north of the Wall for a month or two.,1,3
Tyrion Lannister, So you're heading down to King's Landing too.,1,3
Yoren, Day after tomorrow. I get about half of my recruits from their dungeons.,1,3
Tyrion Lannister, Let's share the road. I could use some decent company.,1,3
Yoren," I travel a bit on the grubby side, my Lord.",1,3
Tyrion Lannister, Not this time. We'll be staying at the finest castles and inns. No one turns away a Lannister.,1,3
Irri," Yes, Khaleesi.",1,3
Daenerys Targaryen, What are you doing?,1,3
Irri," When was last time you bleed, Khaleesi? You change, Khaleesi. It’s a blessing from the Great Stallion.",1,3
Jorah Mormont," For a man on horseback, the curved blade is a good thing, easier to handle. It's a good weapon for a Dothrakan. But a man in full plate... the arakh won't get through the steel. That's where the broadsword has the advantage. Designed for piercing plate.",1,3
Rakharo, Dothraki don’t wear steel dresses.,1,3
Jorah Mormont, Armor.,1,3
Rakharo, Armor. Armor make a man... Vroz?,1,3
Jorah Mormont, Slow.,1,3
Rakharo, Slow.,1,3
Jorah Mormont," It's true, but it also keeps a man alive.",1,3
Rakharo, My father taught me how to fight. He taught me that speed defeats size.,1,3
Jorah Mormont, I’ve heard that your father was a famous warrior.,1,3
Rakharo," He was bloodrider to Khal Bharbo. And your father, Jorah the Andal? He was a warrior also?",1,3
Jorah Mormont, He still is. A man of great honor. And I betrayed him.,1,3
Irri, The Khaleesi wants to eat something different tonight. Kill some rabbits.,1,3
Rakharo, There are no rabbits.,1,3
Irri," Find some ducks, she likes ducks.",1,3
Rakharo," Have you seen any ducks, woman? No rabbits, no ducks. Do you have eyes in your head? Do you?",1,3
Irri, Dog then. I have seen many dogs.,1,3
Jorah Mormont, I don't think she wants to eat dog.,1,3
Irri, The Khaleesi have baby inside her. It is true. She does not bleed for two moons. Her belly start to swell.,1,3
Rakharo, A blessing from the Great Stallion.,1,3
Irri, She does not want to eat horse.,1,3
Jorah Mormont, I'll have the boys butcher a goat for supper. I need to ride to Qohor.,1,3
Rhakaro, We ride for Vaes Dothrak.,1,3
Jorah Mormont, Don't worry. I'll catch you. The horde's easy to find.,1,3
Jon Snow, Don't stand so still. It's harder to hit a moving target. Except for you. You move too much. I could just hold my sword out and let you do the work for me.,1,3
Maester Aemon," How many winters have you seen, Lord Tyrion?",1,3
Tyrion Lannister," Eight... no, nine.",1,3
Maester Aemon, All of them brief?,1,3
Tyrion Lannister," They say the winter of my birth was three years long, Maester Aemon.",1,3
Maester Aemon, This summer has lasted nine. But reports from the Citadel tell us the days grow shorter. The Starks are always right eventually : winter is coming. This one will be long and dark things will come with it.,1,3
Maester Aemon, This summer has lasted nine. But reports from the Citadel tell us the days grow shorter. The Starks are always right eventually : winter is coming. This one will be long and dark things will come with it.,1,3
Jeor Mormont," We've been capturing wildlings, more every month. They're fleeing south. The ones who flee... say they've seen the White Walkers.",1,3
Tyrion Lannister," Yes, and the fishermen of Lannisport say they see mermaids.",1,3
Jeor Mormont, One of our own rangers swore he saw them kill his companions. He swore it right up to the moment Ned Stark chopped his head off.,1,3
Maester Aemon, The Night's Watch is the only thing standing between the realm and what lies beyond. And it has become an army of undisciplined boys and tired old men. There are less than a thousand of us now. We can't man the other castles on the Wall. We can't properly patrol the wilderness. We've barely enough resources to keep our lads armed and fed.,1,3
Jeor Mormont, Your sister sits by the side of the King. Tell her we need help.,1,3
Maester Aemon," When winter does come, gods help us all if we're not ready.",1,3
Daenerys Targaryen, It’s a boy.,1,3
Khal Drogo, How do you know?,1,3
Daenerys Targaryen, I know.,1,3
Jon Snow," I'm sorry to see you leave, Lannister.",1,3
Tyrion Lannister, It's either me or this cold. And it doesn't appear to be going anywhere.,1,3
Jon Snow, Will you stop at Winterfell on your way South?,1,3
Tyrion Lannister, I expect I will. Gods know there aren't many feather beds between here and King's Landing.,1,3
Jon Snow," If you see my brother Bran, tell him I miss him. Tell him I'd visit if I could.",1,3
Tyrion Lannister, Of course.,1,3
Jon Snow, He'll never walk again.,1,3
Tyrion Lannister," If you're going to be a cripple, it's better to be a rich cripple. Take care, Snow.",1,3
Jon Snow," Farewell, My Lord.",1,3
Syrio Forel," You are late, boy. Tomorrow you will be here at midday.",1,3
Arya Stark, Who are you?,1,3
Syrio Forel," Your dancing master, Syrio Forel.",1,3
Syrio Forel," Tomorrow you will catch it. Now pick it up. That is not the way, boy. This is not a great sword that is needing two hands to swing it.",1,3
Arya Stark, It's too heavy.,1,3
Syrio Forel, It is heavy as it needs to be to make you strong. Just so. One hand is all that is needed. Now you are standing all wrong. Turn your body side-face. So. You are skinny. That is good. The target is smaller. Now the grip... Let me see. The grip must be delicate.,1,3
Arya Stark, What if I drop it?,1,3
Syrio Forel," The steel must be part of your arm. Can you drop part of your arm? No. Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword to the Sealord of Braavos. He knows these things. You must listen to me, boy.",1,3
Arya Stark, I'm a girl.,1,3
Syrio Forel," Boy, girl... You are a sword, that is all. That is the grip. You are not holding a battle-axe. You are holding...",1,3
Arya Stark, A needle.,1,3
Syrio Forel," Ahhh… Just so. Now we will begin the dance. Remember, child, this is not the dance of the Westeros we are learning... The knight's dance, hacking and hammering. This is the Bravo's dance... The water dance. It is swift and sudden. All men are made of water, do you know this? If you pierce them, the water leaks out and they die. Now you will try to strike me.",1,3
Syrio Forel," Up! Dead. Dead. Very dead. Come. Again, faster.",1,3
Old Nan, The little Lord's been dreaming again.,1,4
Theon Greyjoy, We have visitors.,1,4
Bran Stark, I don't want to see anyone.,1,4
Theon Greyjoy," Really? If I was cooped up all day with no one but this old bat for company, I'd go mad. Anyway, you don't have a choice. Robb's waiting.",1,4
Bran Stark, I don't want to go.,1,4
Theon Greyjoy," Neither do I. But Robb's Lord of Winterfell, which means I do what he says and you do what I say. Hodor! (Hodor enters, hoisting up Bran and carrying him away) Help Bran down the hall.",1,4
Tyrion Lannister, I must say I received a slightly warmer welcome on my last visit.,1,4
Robb Stark, Any man of the Night's Watch is welcome at Winterfell.,1,4
Tyrion Lannister," Any man of the Night's Watch, but not I, eh, boy?",1,4
Robb Stark," I'm not your boy, Lannister. I'm Lord of Winterfell while my father is away.",1,4
Tyrion Lannister, Then you might learn a lord's courtesy.,1,4
Tyrion Lannister, So it's true. Hello Bran. Do you remember anything about what happened?,1,4
Maester Luwin, He has no memory of that day.,1,4
Tyrion Lannister, Curious.,1,4
Robb Stark, Why are you here?,1,4
Tyrion Lannister, Would your charming companion be so kind as to kneel? My neck is beginning to hurt.,1,4
Bran Stark," Kneel, Hodor.",1,4
Tyrion Lannister," Do you like to ride, Bran?",1,4
Bran Stark," Yes. Well, I mean I did like to.",1,4
Maester Luwin, The boy has lost the use of his legs.,1,4
Tyrion Lannister," What of it? With the right horse and saddle, even a cripple can ride.",1,4
Bran Stark, I'm not a cripple.,1,4
Tyrion Lannister, Then I'm not a dwarf. My father will rejoice to hear it. I have a gift for you. Give that to your saddler. He'll provide the rest. You must shape the horse to the rider. Start with a yearling and teach it to respond to the reins and to the boy's voice.,1,4
Bran Stark, Will I really be able to ride?,1,4
Tyrion Lannister,You will. On horseback you will be as tall as any of them.,1,4
Robb Stark, Is this some kind of trick? Why do you want to help him?,1,4
Tyrion Lannister," I have a tender spot in my heart for cripples, bastards and broken things.",1,4
Robb Stark, You've done my brother a kindness. The hospitality of Winterfell is yours.,1,4
Tyrion Lannister," Spare me your false courtesies, Lord Stark. There's a brothel outside your walls. There I'll find a bed and both of us can sleep easier.",1,4
Theon Greyjoy," Couldn't resist some northern ass? If you like redheads, ask for Ros.",1,4
Tyrion Lannister," Come to see me off, Greyjoy? Kind of you. Your master doesn't seem to like Lannisters.",1,4
Theon Greyjoy, He's not my master.,1,4
Tyrion Lannister," No, of course not. What happened here? Where is lady Stark? Why didn't she receive me?",1,4
Theon Greyjoy, She wasn't feeling well.,1,4
Tyrion Lannister," She's not in Winterfell, is she? Where did she go?",1,4
Theon Greyjoy, My lady's whereabouts...,1,4
Tyrion Lannister," My lady? Your loyalty to your captors is touching. Tell me, how do you think Balon Greyjoy would feel if he could see his only surviving son has turned lackey? I still remember seeing my father's fleet burn in Lannisport. I believe your uncles were responsible?",1,4
Theon Greyjoy, Must have been a pretty sight.,1,4
Tyrion Lannister," Nothing prettier than watching sailors burn alive. Yes, a great victory for your people. Shame how it all turned out.",1,4
Theon Greyjoy, We were outnumbered 10 to one.,1,4
Tyrion Lannister," A stupid rebellion then. I suppose your father realized that when your brothers died in battle. Now here you are, your enemy's squire.",1,4
Theon Greyjoy," Careful, Imp.",1,4
Tyrion Lannister," I've offended you. Forgive me, it's been a rough morning. Anyway, don't despair. I'm a constant disappointment to my own father and I've learned to live with it. Your next tumble with Ros is on me. I'll try not to wear her out.",1,4
Jon Snow," Leg, shoulder, leg. Left foot forward. Good. Now pivot as you deliver the stroke. Put all your weight behind it.",1,4
Grenn, What in seven hells is that?,1,4
Pyp, They'll need an eighth hell to fit him in.,1,4
Alliser Thorne, Tell them your name.,1,4
Samwell Tarly," Samwell Tarly, of Horn Hill. I mean, I was of Horn Hill. I've come to take the black.",1,4
Rast, Come to take the black pudding.,1,4
Alliser Thorne," Well, you couldn't be any worse than you look. See what he can do.",1,4
Samwell Tarly," I yield. Please, no more.",1,4
Alliser Thorne," On your feet. Pick up your sword. Hit him till he finds his feet. It seems they've run short of poachers and thieves down south. Now they send us squealing bloody pigs. Again, harder.",1,4
Jon Snow, Enough! He yielded.,1,4
Alliser Thorne," Looks like the bastard's in love. All right then, lord Snow, you wish to defend your lady love, let's make it an exercise. You two. Three of you ought to be sufficient to make lady piggy squeal. All you've got to do is get past the bastard.",1,4
Jon Snow, Are you sure you want to do this?,1,4
Grenn, No. Yield yield yield! I yield.,1,4
Alliser Thorne, We're done for today. Go clean the armory. That's all you're good for.,1,4
Pyp, Well fought!,1,4
Grenn, Piss off.,1,4
Samwell Tarly, Did he hurt you?,1,4
Jon Snow, I've had worse.,1,4
Samwell Tarly, You can call me Sam... If you want. My mother calls me Sam.,1,4
Jon Snow," It's not going to get any easier, you know? You'll have to defend yourself.",1,4
Grenn, Why didn't you get up and fight?,1,4
Samwell Tarly, I wanted to. I just couldn't.,1,4
Grenn, Why not?,1,4
Samwell Tarly, I'm a coward. My father always says so.,1,4
Jon Snow, The Wall's no place for cowards.,1,4
Samwell Tarly, You're right. I'm sorry. I just... Wanted to thank you.,1,4
Grenn, A bloody coward. People saw us talking to him. Now they'll think we're cowards too.,1,4
Pyp, You're too stupid to be a coward.,1,4
Grenn, You're too stupid to be a...,1,4
Pyp," Quick now, before summer's over.",1,4
Grenn, Come on here!,1,4
Jorah Mormont, Vaes Dothrak. The city of the horselords.,1,4
Viserys Targaryen, A pile of mud. Mud and shit and twigs - best these savages can do.,1,4
Daenerys Targaryen, These are my people now. You shouldn't call them savages.,1,4
Viserys Targaryen," I'll call them what I like, because they're my people. This is my army. Khal Drogo is marching the wrong way with my army.",1,4
Daenerys Targaryen," If my brother was given an army of Dothraki, could you conquer the Seven Kingdoms?",1,4
Jorah Mormont, The Dothraki have never crossed the Narrow Sea. They fear any water their horses can't drink.,1,4
Daenerys Targaryen, But if they did?,1,4
Jorah Mormont," King Robert is fool enough to meet them in open battle, but the men advising him are different.",1,4
Daenerys Targaryen, And you know these men?,1,4
Jorah Mormont," I fought beside them once, long ago. Now Ned Stark wants my head. He drove me from my land.",1,4
Daenerys Targaryen, You sold slaves.,1,4
Jorah Mormont, Aye.,1,4
Daenerys Targaryen, Why?,1,4
Jorah Mormont, I had no money and an expensive wife.,1,4
Daenerys Targaryen, And where is she now?,1,4
Jorah Mormont," In another place, with another man.",1,4
Doreah, Your Grace?,1,4
Viserys Targaryen," Yes, my dear?",1,4
Doreah, They call you the last dragon...,1,4
Viserys Targaryen, They do.,1,4
Doreah, You have dragon's blood in your veins?,1,4
Viserys Targaryen, It's entirely possible.,1,4
Doreah, What happened to the dragons? I was told that brave men killed them all.,1,4
Viserys Targaryen," The brave men didn't kill dragons. The brave men rode them. Rode them from Valyria to build the greatest civilization this world has ever seen. The breath of the greatest dragon forged the Iron Throne, which the Usurper is keeping warm for me. The swords of the vanquished, a thousand of them... melted together like so many candles.",1,4
Doreah, I have always wanted to see a dragon. There is nothing in the world that I would rather see.,1,4
Viserys Targaryen,Really? Why dragons?,1,4
Doreah," They can fly. And wherever they are, just a few flaps of their wings and they're somewhere else... Far away. And they can kill. Anyone or anything that tries to hurt them gets burned away to nothing... melted... like so many candles. Seeing a dragon would make me very happy.",1,4
Viserys Targaryen," Well, after 15 years in a pleasure house, I imagine just seeing the sky makes you happy.",1,4
Doreah, I was not locked in. I have seen things.,1,4
Viserys Targaryen, What have you seen?,1,4
Doreah, I've seen... A man from Asshai with a dagger of real dragonglass. I've seen a man who could change his face the way that other men change their clothes. And I've seen a pirate who wore his weight in gold and whose ship had sails of colored silk. So... Have you seen one?,1,4
Viserys Targaryen, A pirate ship?,1,4
Doreah, A dragon.,1,4
Viserys Targaryen," No, the last one died many years before I was born. I'll tell you what I have seen : their skulls. They used to decorate the throne room in the Red Keep. When I was very young, just 3 or 4, my father used to walk me down the rows and I'd recite their names for him. When I got them all right, he'd give me a sweet. The ones closest to the door were the last ones they were able to hatch and they were all stunted and wrong. Skulls no bigger than dog skulls. But as you got closer to the Iron Throne... They got bigger and bigger and bigger. There was Ghiscar and Valryon, Vermithrax, Essovius, Archonel, Meraxes, Vhagar... And Balerion the Dread... whose fire forged the Seven Kingdoms into one.",1,4

Doreah, What happened to the skulls?,1,4
Viserys Targaryen," I don't know. The Usurper had them smashed to powder, I expect. Scattered to the wind.",1,4
Doreah, That's very sad.,1,4
Viserys Targaryen," Yes, it is. What did I buy you for? To make me sad?",1,4
Doreah," No, your Grace. To teach your sister.",1,4
Viserys Targaryen, To teach my sister how to be a better lover? You think I bought you to make Khal Drogo happy? You pretty little idiot. Go on then. Get on with it.,1,4
Septa Mordane," Someday your husband will sit there and you will sit by his side. And one day, before too long, you will present your son to the court. All the lords of Westeros will gather here to see the little prince...",1,4
Sansa Stark, What if I have a girl?,1,4
Septa Mordane," Gods be good, you'll have boys and girls and plenty of them.",1,4
Sansa Stark, What if I only have girls?,1,4
Septa Mordane, I wouldn't worry about that.,1,4
Sansa Stark," Jeyne Poole's mother had five children, all of them girls.",1,4
Septa Mordane," Yes, but it's highly unlikely.",1,4
Sansa Stark, But what if?,1,4
Septa Mordane," If you only had girls, I suppose the throne would pass to Prince Joffrey's little brother.",1,4
Sansa Stark, And everyone would hate me.,1,4
Septa Mordane, Nobody could ever hate you.,1,4
Sansa Stark, Joffrey does.,1,4
Septa Mordane, Nonsense. Why would you say such a thing? That business with the wolves? I've told you a hundred times... A direwolf is not...,1,4
Sansa Stark, Please shut up about it.,1,4
Septa Mordane, Do you remember your lessons? Who built the Iron Throne?,1,4
Sansa Stark, Aegon the Conqueror.,1,4
Septa Mordane, And who built the Red Keep?,1,4
Sansa Stark, Maegor the Cruel.,1,4
Septa Mordane, And how many years did it take to build...,1,4
Sansa Stark," My grandfather and uncle were murdered here, weren't they?",1,4
Septa Mordane," They were killed on the orders of King Aerys, yes.",1,4
Sansa Stark, The Mad King.,1,4
Septa Mordane, Commonly known as the Mad King.,1,4
Sansa Stark, Why were they killed?,1,4
Septa Mordane, You should speak to your father about these matters.,1,4
Sansa Stark," I don't want to speak to my father, ever.",1,4
Septa Mordane, You will find it in your heart to forgive your father.,1,4
Sansa Stark," No, I won't.",1,4
Janos Slynt," It's the Hand's tournament that's causing all this trouble, my Lords.",1,4
Eddard Stark, The King's tournament. I assure you the Hand wants no part of it.,1,4
Janos Slynt," Call it what you will, Lord Stark Ser, the city is packed with people and more flooding in every day. Last night we had a tavern riot, a brothel fire, three stabbings and a drunken horse race down the Street of Sisters.",1,4
Varys, Dreadful.,1,4
Renly Baratheon," If you can't keep the King's peace, perhaps the City Watch should be commanded by someone who can.",1,4
Janos Slynt, I need more men.,1,4
Eddard Stark, You'll get 50. Lord Baelish will see it paid for.,1,4
Petyr Baelish, I will?,1,4
Eddard Stark," You found money for a champion's purse, you can find money to keep the peace. I'll also give you 20 of my household guards till the crowds have left.",1,4
Janos Slynt," Thank you, my Lord Hand Ser. They will be put to good use.",1,4
Eddard Stark," The sooner this is over, the better.",1,4
Varys," The realm prospers from such events, my Lord. They give the great a chance at glory, and the lowly a respite from their woes.",1,4
Petyr Baelish, And every inn in the city is full and the whores are walking bow-legged.,1,4
Eddard Stark," I'm sure the tourney puts coins in many a pocket. Now... If there's nothing else, my Lords?",1,4
Grand Maester Pycelle," This heat. On days like this, I envy you northerners your summer snows. Until tomorrow my Lord.",1,4
Eddard Stark, I've been hoping to talk to you about Jon Arryn.,1,4
Grand Maester Pycelle," Lord Arryn? His death was a great sadness to all of us. I took personal charge of his care, but I could not save him. His sickness struck him very hard and very fast. I saw him in my chambers just the night before he passed. Lord Jon often came to me for counsel.",1,4
Eddard Stark, Why?,1,4
Grand Maester Pycelle, I have been Grand Maester for many years. Kings and Hands have come to me for advice since...,1,4
Eddard Stark, What did Jon want the night before he died?,1,4
Grand Maester Pycelle, He came inquiring after a book.,1,4
Eddard Stark, A book? What book?,1,4
Grand Maester Pycelle," I fear it would be of little interest to you, my Lord. A ponderous tome.",1,4
Eddard Stark, I'd like to read it.,1,4
Grand Maester Pycelle," ""The lineages and histories of the great houses of the Seven Kingdoms, with descriptions of many high lords and noble ladies and their children.""",1,4
Eddard Stark," ""Harkon Umber, first of his name, born to lord Hother Umber and lady Amaryllis Umber in the 183rd year after Aegon's landing, at the last hearth. Blue of eye, brown of hair and fair complected, died in his 14th year of a wound sustained",1,4
Grand Maester Pycelle," As I said, my Lord, a ponderous read.",1,4
Eddard Stark, Did Jon Arryn tell you what he wanted with it?,1,4
Grand Maester Pycelle," He did not, my Lord. And I did not presume to ask.",1,4
Eddard Stark, Jon's death...,1,4
Grand Maester Pycelle, Such a tragedy.,1,4
Eddard Stark, Did he say anything to you during his final hours?,1,4
Grand Maester Pycelle,"Nothing of import, my Lord. There was one phrase he kept repeating: ""The seed is strong,"" I think it was.",1,4
Grand Maester Pycelle,"Nothing of import, my Lord. There was one phrase he kept repeating: ""The seed is strong,"" I think it was.",1,4
Eddard Stark," ""The seed is strong""? What does that mean?",1,4
Grand Maester Pycelle," The dying mind is a demented mind, Lord Stark. For all the weight they're given, last words are usually as significant as first words.",1,4
Eddard Stark, And you're quite certain he died of a natural illness?,1,4
Grand Maester Pycelle, What else could it be?,1,4
Eddard Stark, Poison.,1,4
Grand Maester Pycelle, A disturbing thought. I don't think it likely. The Hand was loved by all. What sort of man would dare...,1,4
Eddard Stark, I've heard it said that poison is a woman's weapon.,1,4
Grand Maester Pycelle," Yes. Women, cravens... and eunuchs. Did you know that lord Varys is a eunuch?",1,4
Eddard Stark, Everybody knows that.,1,4
Grand Maester Pycelle," Yes, yes, of course. How that sort of person found himself on the King's Council, I will never know.",1,4
Eddard Stark, I've taken enough of your time.,1,4
Grand Maester Pycelle," No trouble at all, my Lord. It's a great honor...",1,4
Eddard Stark, Thank you. I'll find my own way out.,1,4
Arya Stark, Syrio says a water dancer can stand on one toe for hours.,1,4
Eddard Stark, It's a hard fall down these steps.,1,4
Arya Stark, Syrio says every hurt is a lesson and every lesson makes you better. Tomorrow I'm going to be chasing cats.,1,4
Eddard Stark, Cats? Syrio says…,1,4
Arya Stark, He says every swordsman should study cats. They're quiet as shadows and as light as feathers. You have to be quick to catch them.,1,4
Eddard Stark, He's right about that.,1,4
Arya Stark, Now that Bran's awake will he come live with us?,1,4
Eddard Stark, He needs to get his strength back first.,1,4
Arya Stark,"He wants to be a knight of the King’s Guard. He can't be one now, can he?",1,4
Eddard Stark, No. But someday he could be Lord of a holdfast or sit on the King's Council. Or he might raise castles like Brandon the Builder.,1,4
Arya Stark, Can I be Lord of a holdfast?,1,4
Eddard Stark, You will marry a high Lord and rule his castle. And your sons shall be knights and princes and lords.,1,4
Arya Stark, No. That's not me.,1,4
Samwell Tarly," Hello. Ser Alliser said I'm to be your new watch partner. I should warn you, I don't see all that well.",1,4
Jon Snow, Come stand by the fire. It's warmer.,1,4
Samwell Tarly," No, that's all right. I'm fine.",1,4
Jon Snow, You're not. You're freezing.,1,4
Samwell Tarly, I don't like high places.,1,4
Jon Snow," You can't fight. You can't see. You're afraid of heights and almost everything else probably. What are you doing here, Sam?",1,4
Samwell Tarly," On the morning of my 18th nameday, my father came to me. ""You're almost a man now,"" he said, ""but you're not worthy of my land and title. Tomorrow, you're going to take the black, forsake all claim to your inheritance and start north. If you do not,"" he said, ""then we'll have a hunt and somewhere in these woods your horse will stumble and you'll be thrown from your saddle to die. Or so I'll tell your mother. Nothing would please me more."" Ser Alliser's going to make me fight again tomorrow, isn't he?",1,4
Jon Snow," Yes, he is.",1,4
Samwell Tarly," I'm not going to get any better, you know?",1,4
Jon Snow, Well… You can't get any worse.,1,4
Petyr Baelish, I hear you're reading a boring book.,1,4
Eddard Stark, Pycelle talks too much.,1,4
Petyr Baelish," He never stops. Do you know Ser Hugh of the Vale? Not surprising. Until recently, he was only a squire... Jon Arryn's squire. He was knighted almost immediately after his master's untimely death.",1,4
Eddard Stark, Knighted for what? Why are you telling me this?,1,4
Petyr Baelish, I promised Cat that I'd help you.,1,4
Eddard Stark, Where is Ser Hugh? I'll speak to him.,1,4
Petyr Baelish, A singularly bad idea. Do you see that boy there? One of Varys's little birds. The Spider has taken a great interest in your comings and goings. Now look there. That one belongs to the Queen. And do you see that Septa pretending to read her book?,1,4
Eddard Stark, Varys or the Queen?,1,4
Petyr Baelish, No. She's one of mine. Is there someone in your service whom you trust completely?,1,4
Eddard Stark, Yes.,1,4
Petyr Baelish," The wiser answer was no, my Lord. Get a message to this paragon of yours... Discreetly. Send him to question Ser Hugh. After that, you might want him to visit a certain armorer in the city. He lives in a large house at the top of the street of Steel.",1,4
Eddard Stark, Why?,1,4
Petyr Baelish," I have my observers, as I said, and it's possible that they saw Lord Arryn visit this armorer several times in the weeks before his death.",1,4
Eddard Stark," Lord Baelish, perhaps I was wrong to distrust you.",1,4
Petyr Baelish, Distrusting me was the wisest thing you've done since you climbed off your horse.,1,4
Jory Cassel, Ser Hugh? Ser Hugh!,1,4
Hugh of the Vale," As you can see, I'm busy.",1,4
Jory Cassel," I'm here on behalf of Lord Eddard Stark, the Hand of the king. I'm the captain of his guard.",1,4
Hugh of the Vale," I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name, Ser...",1,4
Jory Cassel," No ""ser."" I'm not a knight.",1,4
Hugh of the Vale," I see. Well, it just so happens that I am.",1,4
Jory Cassel," He said he'd be glad to talk to the Hand himself. He's a knight, you see.",1,4
Eddard Stark, A knight. They strut around like roosters down here. Even the ones who've never seen an arrow coming their way.,1,4
Jory Cassel," You shouldn't be out here, my Lord. There's no telling who has eyes where.",1,4
Eddard Stark, Let them look.,1,4
Tobho Mott," The former Hand did call on me, my Lord, several times. I regret to say he did not honor me with his patronage.",1,4
Eddard Stark, What did Lord Arryn want?,1,4
Tobho Mott, He always came to see the boy.,1,4
Eddard Stark, I'd like to see him as well.,1,4
Tobho Mott," As you wish, my Lord. Gendry! Here he is. Strong for his age. He works hard. Show the Hand the helmet you made, lad.",1,4
Eddard Stark, This is fine work.,1,4
Gendry, It's not for sale.,1,4
Tobho Mott," Boy, this is the King's Hand! If his lordship wants the helmet...",1,4
Gendry, I made it for me.,1,4
Tobho Mott," Forgive him, my Lord.",1,4
Eddard Stark," There's nothing to forgive. When Lord Arryn came to visit you, what would you talk about?",1,4
Gendry," He just asked me questions is all, my Lord.",1,4
Eddard Stark, What kind of questions?,1,4
Gendry," About my work at first, if I was being treated well, if I liked it here. But then he started asking me about my mother.",1,4
Eddard Stark, Your mother?,1,4
Gendry," Who she was, what she looked like.",1,4
Eddard Stark, What did you tell him?,1,4
Gendry, She died when I was little. She had yellow hair. She'd sing to me sometimes.,1,4
Eddard Stark," Look at me. Get back to work, lad. If the day ever comes when that boy'd rather wield a sword than forge one, you send him to me.",1,4
Jory Cassel, Find anything?,1,4
Eddard Stark, King Robert's bastard son.,1,4
Jory Cassel, This is for the King from Lord Stark.,1,4
Jaime Lannister, Listen. Do you hear them? How many do you think are in there with him? Guess.,1,4
Jory Cassel, Three? Four?,1,4
Jaime Lannister, He likes to do this when I'm on duty... He makes me listen as he insults my sister.,1,4
Jory Cassel," Forgive me, my Lord...",1,4
Jaime Lannister, Why do I have to forgive you? Have you wronged me?,1,4
Jory Cassel," We've met before, you know.",1,4
Jaime Lannister," Have we? Strange, I've forgotten.",1,4
Jory Cassel, The siege of Pyke. We fought side by side one afternoon.,1,4
Jaime Lannister, That's where you got your scar?,1,4
Jory Cassel, Aye. One of the Greyjoys nearly took my eye.,1,4
Jaime Lannister, Vicious sons of whores.,1,4
Jory Cassel, They like their bloodshed.,1,4
Jaime Lannister, They stopped liking it at the end. That was a proper battle. D'you remember Thoros of Myr charging through the breach?,1,4
Jory Cassel, With his burning sword? I'll remember that till the day I die.,1,4
Jaime Lannister, I saw the youngest of the Greyjoy lads at Winterfell. It was like seeing a shark on a mountaintop.,1,4
Jory Cassel, Theon? He's a good lad.,1,4
Jaime Lannister, I doubt it.,1,4
Robert Baratheon, I'll bet you smell of blackberry jam! Let me smell it. Come here.,1,4
Jory Cassel, Can I leave this with you? The message from Lord Stark.,1,4
Jaime Lannister, I don't serve Lord Stark.,1,4
Grenn, Where have you been?,1,4
Jon Snow, Watch duty. With Sam.,1,4
Pyp, Prince Porkchop. Where is he?,1,4
Jon Snow, He wasn't hungry.,1,4
Pyp, Impossible!,1,4
Jon Snow," That's enough. Sam's no different from the rest of us. There was no place for him in the world, so he's come here. We're not going to hurt him in the training yard anymore. Never again, no matter what Thorne says. He's our brother now and we're going to protect him.",1,4
Rast," You are in love, Lord Snow. You girls can do as you please. But if Thorne puts me up against Lady Piggy, I'm gonna slice me off a side of bacon.",1,4
Jon Snow, No one touches Sam.,1,4
Alliser Thorne," What are you waiting for? Attack him! You, get in there.",1,4
Grenn," Hit me. Go on, hit me! I yield! Yield yield. I yield.",1,4
Alliser Thorne," You think this is funny, do you? When you're out there beyond the Wall with the sun going down, do you want a man at your back? Or a sniveling boy?",1,4
Viserys Targaryen, You send this whore to give me commands? I should have sent you back her head!,1,4
Doreah," Forgive me, Khaleesi. I did as you asked.",1,4
Daenerys Targaryen," Hush now. It's all right. Irri, take her and leave us.",1,4
Irri," Yes, Khaleesi.",1,4
Daenerys Targaryen, Why did you hit her?!,1,4
Viserys Targaryen, How many times do I have to tell you? You do not command me.,1,4
Daenerys Targaryen, I wasn't commanding you. I just wanted to invite you to supper.,1,4
Viserys Targaryen, What's this?,1,4
Daenerys Targaryen, It's a gift. I had it made for you.,1,4
Viserys Targaryen, Dothraki rags? Are you going to dress me now?,1,4
Daenerys Targaryen, Please.,1,4
Viserys Targaryen, This stinks of manure. All of it.,1,4
Daenerys Targaryen, Stop - stop it.,1,4
Viserys Targaryen," You would turn me into one of them, wouldn't you? Next you'll want to braid my hair.",1,4
Daenerys Targaryen, You've no right to a braid. You've won no victories yet.,1,4
Viserys Targaryen, You do not talk back to me!,1,4
Viserys Targaryen, You are a horselord's slut. And now you've woken the dragon...,1,4
Daenerys Targaryen, I am a Khaleesi of the Dothraki! I am the wife of the great Khal and I carry his son inside me. The next time you raise a hand to me will be the last time you have hands.,1,4
Samwell Tarly, I know for a fact that some of the officers go to that brothel in Mole's Town.,1,4
Jon Snow, I wouldn't doubt it.,1,4
Samwell Tarly, Don't you think it's a little bit unfair? Making us take our vows while they sneak off for a little sally on the side?,1,4
Jon Snow, Sally on the side?,1,4
Samwell Tarly,"It's silly, isn't it? What, we can't defend the Wall unless we're celibate? It's absurd.",1,4
Jon Snow, I didn't think you'd be so upset about it.,1,4
Samwell Tarly,Why not? Because I'm fat? But I like girls just as much as you do. They might not like me as much. I've never... been with one. You've probably had hundreds.,1,4
Jon Snow," As a matter of fact, I'm the same as you.",1,4
Samwell Tarly, I find that hard to believe.,1,4
Jon Snow," I came very close once. I was alone in a room with a naked girl, but...",1,4
Samwell Tarly,You didn't know where to put it?,1,4
Jon Snow, I know where to put it.,1,4
Samwell Tarly,Was she... Old and ugly?,1,4
Jon Snow, Young and gorgeous. A whore named Ros.,1,4
Samwell Tarly, What color hair?,1,4
Jon Snow, Red.,1,4
Samwell Tarly, I like red hair. And her... Her...,1,4
Jon Snow, You don't want to know.,1,4
Samwell Tarly, That good?,1,4
Jon Snow, Better.,1,4
Samwell Tarly, Oh no. So why exactly did you not make love to Ros with the perfect...,1,4
Jon Snow, What's my name?,1,4
Samwell Tarly, Jon Snow?,1,4
Jon Snow, And why is my surname Snow?,1,4
Samwell Tarly, Because... You're a bastard from the north.,1,4
Jon Snow," I never met my mother. My father wouldn't even tell me her name. I don't know if she's living or dead. I don't know if she's a noblewoman or a fisherman's wife... Or a whore. So I sat there in the brothel as Ros took off her clothes. But I couldn't do it. Because all I could think was what if I got her pregnant and she had a child, another bastard named Snow? It's not a good life for a child.",1,4
Samwell Tarly, So... You didn't know where to put it?,1,4
Alliser Thorne," Enjoying yourselves? You look cold, boys.",1,4
Samwell Tarly, It is a bit nippy.,1,4
Alliser Thorne," A bit nippy, yeah, by the fire, indoors. It's still summer. Do you boys even remember the last winter? How long has it been now? What, 10 years? I remember. Was it uncomfortable at Winterfell? Were there days when you just couldn't get warm, never mind how many fires your servants built?",1,4
Jon Snow, I build my own fires.,1,4
Alliser Thorne," That's admirable. I spent six months out there, beyond the Wall during the last winter. It was supposed to be a two-week mission. We heard a rumor Mance Rayder was planning to attack Eastwatch. So we went out to look for some of his men... Capture them, gather some knowledge. The Wildlings who fight for Mance Rayder are hard men. Harder than you'll ever be. They know their country better than we do. They knew there was a storm coming in. So they hid in their caves and waited for it to pass. And we got caught in the open. Wind so strong it yanked 100-foot trees straight from the ground, roots and all. If you took your gloves off to find your cock to have a piss, you lost a finger to the frost. And all in darkness. You don't know cold. Neither of you do. The horses died first. We didn't have enough to feed them, to keep them warm. Eating the horses was easy. But later when we started to fall... That wasn't easy. We should have had a couple of boys like you along, shouldn't we? Soft, fat boys like you. We'd have lasted a fortnight on you and still had bones leftover for soup. Soon we'll have new recruits and you lot will be passed along to the Lord Commander for assignment and they will call you men of the Night's Watch, but you'd be fools to believe it. You're boys still. And come the winter you will die... Like flies.",1,4
Daenerys Targaryen, I hit him. I hit the dragon.,1,4
Jorah Mormont, Your brother Rhaegar was the last dragon. Viserys is less than the shadow of a snake.,1,4
Daenerys Targaryen, He is still the true King.,1,4
Jorah Mormont, The truth now: do you want to see your brother sitting on the Iron Throne?,1,4
Jorah Mormont, The truth now: do you want to see your brother sitting on the Iron Throne?,1,4
Daenerys Targaryen, No. But the common people are waiting for him. Illyrio said they're sewing dragon banners and praying for his return.,1,4
Jorah Mormont," The common people pray for rain, health and a summer that never ends. They don't care what games the high Lords play.",1,4
Daenerys Targaryen,"What do you pray for, Ser Jorah?",1,4
Jorah Mormont, Home.,1,4
Daenerys Targaryen, I pray for home too. My brother will never take back the Seven Kingdoms. He couldn't lead an army even if my husband gave him one. He'll never take us home.,1,4
Petyr Baelish, Lover's quarrel?,1,4
Sansa Stark, I'm sorry. Do I...?,1,4
Septa Mordane," Sansa dear, this is Lord Baelish. He's known...",1,4
Petyr Baelish, An old friend of the family. I've known your mother a long long time.,1,4
Arya Stark, Why do they call you Littlefinger?,1,4
Sansa Stark, Arya!,1,4
Septa Mordane, Don't be rude!,1,4
Petyr Baelish," No, it's quite all right. When I was a child I was very small and I come from a little spit of land called The Fingers, so you see, it's an exceedingly clever nickname.",1,4
Robert Baratheon, I've been sitting here for days! Start the damn joust before I piss myself!,1,4
Sansa Stark," Gods, who is that?",1,4
Petyr Baelish, Ser Gregor Clegane. They call him the Mountain. The Hound's older brother.,1,4
Sansa Stark, And his opponent?,1,4
Petyr Baelish, Ser Hugh of the Vale. He was Jon Arryn's squire. Look how far he's come.,1,4
Robert Baratheon," Yes, yes. Enough of the bloody pomp. Have at it!",1,4
Petyr Baelish," Not what you were expecting? Has anyone ever told you the story of the Mountain and the Hound? Lovely little tale of brotherly love. The Hound was just a pup, six years old maybe. Gregor a few years older, already a big lad, already getting a bit of a reputation. Some lucky boys just born with a talent for violence. One evening... Gregor found his little brother playing with a toy by the fire... Gregor's toy, a wooden knight. Gregor never said a word, he just grabbed his brother by the scruff of his neck and shoved his face into the burning coals. Held him there while the boy screamed, while his face melted. There aren't very many people who know that story.",1,4
Sansa Stark, I won't tell anyone. I promise.,1,4
Petyr Baelish," No, please don't. If the Hound so much as heard you mention it, I'm afraid all the knights in King's Landing would not be able to save you.",1,4
Jory Cassel," My Lord, Her Grace the Queen.",1,4
Eddard Stark, Your Grace.,1,4
Cersei Baratheon, You're missing your tournament.,1,4
Eddard Stark, Putting my name on it doesn't make it mine.,1,4
Cersei Baratheon, I thought we might put what happened on the Kingsroad behind us – the ugliness with the wolves. And forcing you to kill the beast was extreme. Though sometimes we go to extremes where our children are concerned. How is Sansa?,1,4
Eddard Stark, She likes it here.,1,4
Cersei Baratheon," The only Stark who does. Favors her mother, not much of the north in her.",1,4
Eddard Stark, What are you doing here?,1,4
Cersei Baratheon, I might ask the same of you. What is it you hope to accomplish?,1,4
Eddard Stark," The King called on me to serve him and the realm, and that's what I'll do until he tells me otherwise.",1,4
Cersei Baratheon," You can't change him. You can't help him. He'll do what he wants, which is all he's ever done. You'll try your best to pick up the pieces.",1,4
Eddard Stark," If that's my job, then so be it.",1,4
Cersei Baratheon," You're just a soldier, aren't you? You take your orders and you carry on. I suppose it makes sense. Your older brother was trained to lead and you were trained to follow.",1,4
Eddard Stark," I was also trained to kill my enemies, Your Grace.",1,4
Cersei Baratheon, As was I.,1,4
Marillion," Seven blessings to you, goodfolk!",1,4
Catelyn Stark, And to you.,1,4
Rodrick Cassel," Boy! Bread, meat and beer, quickly.",1,4
Marillion," Good idea, grandfather. I'm starving. A song while we wait or?",1,4
Rodrick Cassel, I'd rather throw myself down a well.,1,4
Marillion," Grandfather, may be your last chance if you're heading north. The only music the northerners know is the howling of wolves!",1,4
Masha Heddle," I'm sorry, my Lord, we're full up. Every room.",1,4
Tyrion Lannister," My men can sleep in the stable. As for myself, I don't require a large room.",1,4
Masha Heddle," Truly, my lord, we have nothing.",1,4
Tyrion Lannister, Is there nothing I can do... to remedy this?,1,4
Bronn, You can have my room.,1,4
Tyrion Lannister," There's a clever man. You can manage food, I trust? Yoren, dine with me.",1,4
Yoren," Aye, my Lord.",1,4
Marillion, My Lord of Lannister! Might I entertain you while you eat? I can sing of your father's victory at King's Landing!,1,4
Tyrion Lannister, Nothing would more likely ruin my supper. Lady Stark! What an unexpected pleasure. I was sorry to have missed you at Winterfell.,1,4
Masha Heddle, Lady Stark.,1,4
Catelyn Stark," I was still Catelyn Tully the last time I stayed here. You, Ser... Is that the black bat of Harrenhal I see embroidered on your coat?",1,4
Knight of House Whent," It is, my Lady.",1,4
Catelyn Stark, And is Lady Whent a true and honest friend to my father... Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun?,1,4
Knight of House Whent, She is.,1,4
Catelyn Stark, The red stallion was always a welcome sight at Riverrun. My father counts Jonas Bracken amongst his oldest and most loyal bannermen.,1,4
Knight of House Bracken, Our lord is honored by his trust.,1,4
Tyrion Lannister," I envy your father all his fine friends, but I don't quite see the purpose of this.",1,4
Catelyn Stark,"Knight of House Frey: Lord Walder is well, my Lady. He has asked your father for the honor of his presence on his 90th nameday. He plans to take another wife.",1,4
Catelyn Stark,"Knight of House Frey: Lord Walder is well, my Lady. He has asked your father for the honor of his presence on his 90th nameday. He plans to take another wife.",1,4
Catelyn Stark," This man... Came into my house as a guest and there conspired to murder my son, a boy of 10. In the name of King Robert and the good Lords you serve, I call upon you to seize him and help me return him to Winterfell to await the king's justice.",1,4
Eddard Stark, Does Ser Hugh have any family in the capital?,1,5
Barristan Selmy, No. I stood vigil for him myself last night. He had no one else.,1,5
Eddard Stark, He'd never worn this armor before.,1,5
Barristan Selmy, Bad luck for him... Going against the Mountain.,1,5
Eddard Stark, Who determines the draw?,1,5
Barristan Selmy," All the knights draw straws, Lord Stark.",1,5
Eddard Stark," Aye... But who holds the straws? You've done good work, Sisters.",1,5
Barristan Selmy, Life is strange. Not so many years ago we fought as enemies at the Trident.,1,5
Eddard Stark," I'm glad we never met on the field, Ser Barristan... as is my wife. I don't think the widow's life would suit her.",1,5
Barristan Selmy, You're too modest. I've seen you cut down a dozen great knights.,1,5
Eddard Stark, My father once told me you were the best he'd ever seen. I never knew the man to be wrong about matters of combat.,1,5
Barristan Selmy," He was a fine man, your father. What the Mad King did to him was a terrible crime.",1,5
Eddard Stark, And that lad... He was a squire until a few months ago. How could he afford a new suit of armor?,1,5
Barristan Selmy, Perhaps Lord Arryn left him some money? I hear the King wants to joust today.,1,5
Eddard Stark, Yes. That will never happen.,1,5
Barristan Selmy, Robert tends to do what he wants.,1,5
Eddard Stark," If the King got what he wanted all the time, we'd still be fighting a damned rebellion.",1,5
Lancel Lannister," It's made too small, Your Grace. It won't go.",1,5
Robert Baratheon, Your mother was a dumb whore with a fat arse. Did you know that? Look at this idiot! One ball and no brains. He can't even put a man's armor on him properly.,1,5
Eddard Stark, You're too fat for your armor.,1,5
Robert Baratheon," Fat? Fat, is it? Is that how you speak to your King? That was funny, is it?",1,5
Robert Baratheon," Oh, it’s funny, is it?",1,5
Lancel Lannister," No, Your Grace.",1,5
Robert Baratheon, No? You don't like the Hand's joke?,1,5
Eddard Stark, You're torturing the poor boy.,1,5
Robert Baratheon," You heard the Hand. The King's too fat for his armor! Go find the breastplate stretcher, now!",1,5
Eddard Stark, The breastplate stretcher?,1,5
Robert Baratheon, How long before he figures it out?,1,5
Eddard Stark, Maybe you should have one invented.,1,5
Robert Baratheon," All right, all right. But you watch me out there. I still know how to point a lance.",1,5
Eddard Stark, You have no business jousting. Leave that for the young men.,1,5
Robert Baratheon, Why? Because I'm king? Piss on that. I want to hit somebody!,1,5
Eddard Stark, And who's going to hit you back?,1,5
Robert Baratheon, Anybody who can. And the last man in his saddle... will be you!,1,5
Eddard Stark,There's not a man in the Seven Kingdoms would risk hurting you.,1,5
Robert Baratheon, Are you telling me those cowards would let me win?,1,5
Eddard Stark, Aye.,1,5
Robert Baratheon, … Drink.,1,5
Eddard Stark, I'm not thirsty.,1,5
Robert Baratheon, Drink. Your King commands it. Gods! Too fat for my armor.,1,5
Eddard Stark, Your squire... A Lannister boy?,1,5
Robert Baratheon," Hmm... A bloody idiot... But Cersei insisted. I have Jon Arryn to thank for her. ""Cersei Lannister will make a good match"", he told me. ""You'll need her father on your side."" I thought being King meant I could do whatever I wanted. Enough of this! Let's go watch 'em ride. At least I can smell someone else's blood.",1,5
Eddard Stark, Robert?,1,5
Robert Baratheon," What? Oh! An inspiring sight for the people, eh? Come! Bow before your King! Bow, you shits!",1,5
Eddard Stark, Where's Arya,1,5
Sansa Stark, At her dancing lessons. The Knight of the Flowers.,1,5
Sansa Stark," Thank you, Ser Loras.",1,5
Sansa Stark, Don't let Ser Gregor hurt him.,1,5
Eddard Stark, Hey.,1,5
Sansa Stark, I can't watch.,1,5
Petyr Baelish, 100 gold dragons on the Mountain.,1,5
Renly Baratheon, I'll take that bet.,1,5
Petyr Baelish, Now what will I buy with 100 gold dragons? A dozen barrels of Dornish wine? Or a girl from the pleasure houses of Lys?,1,5
Renly Baratheon, Or you could even buy a friend.,1,5
Sansa Stark, He's going to die.,1,5
Eddard Stark, Ser Loras rides well.,1,5
Renly Baratheon," Such a shame, Littlefinger. It would have been so nice for you to have a friend.",1,5
Petyr Baelish," And tell me, Lord Renly, when will you be having your friend?",1,5
Petyr Baelish," Loras knew his mare was in heat. Quite crafty, really.",1,5
Sansa Stark, Ser Loras would never do that! There's no honor in tricks.,1,5
Petyr Baelish, No honor but quite a bit of gold.,1,5
Robert Baratheon, Stop this madness in the name of your King!,1,5
Loras Tyrell," I owe you my life, Ser.",1,5
Sandor Clegane, I'm no Ser.,1,5
Catelyn Stark, Remove his hood.,1,5
Marillion," On that eve, the captive Imp down-wards from his horse did limp, no more would he preen and primp, in garb of red and gold. (singing)",1,5
Tyrion Lannister, This isn't the Kingsroad. You said we were riding for Winterfell.,1,5
Catelyn Stark, I did... often and loudly.,1,5
Tyrion Lannister," Very wise. They'll be out in droves, looking for me in the wrong place. Word's probably gotten to my father by now. He'll be offering a handsome reward. Everyone knows a Lannister always pays his debts. Would you be so good as to untie me?",1,5
Catelyn Stark, And why would I do that?,1,5
Tyrion Lannister, Why not? Am I going to run? The hill tribes would kill me for my boots. Unless a Shadowcat ate me first.,1,5
Catelyn Stark, Shadowcats and hill tribes are the least of your concerns.,1,5
Tyrion Lannister," Ah... the Eastern Road. We're going to The Vale. You're taking me to your sister's to answer for my imagined crimes. Tell me, Lady Stark. When was the last time you saw your sister?",1,5
Catelyn Stark, Five years ago.,1,5
Tyrion Lannister," She's changed. She was always a bit touched, but now... you might as well kill me here.",1,5
Catelyn Stark," I am not a murderer, Lannister.",1,5
Tyrion Lannister, Neither am I! I had nothing to do with the attempt on your son's life!,1,5
Catelyn Stark, The dagger found,1,5
Tyrion Lannister, What sort of imbecile arms an assassin with his own blade?,1,5
Rodrik Cassel, Should I gag him?,1,5
Tyrion Lannister, Why? Am I starting to make sense?,1,5
Rodrik Cassel," My Lady, this way.",1,5
Tyrion Lannister," Untie me. If I die, what's the point?",1,5
Catelyn Stark, Rodrik?,1,5
Rodrik Cassel," I'll be fine, my Lady. There's no need to bloody yourself.",1,5
Bronn, Your first? You need a woman. Nothing like a woman after a fight.,1,5
Tyrion Lannister," Well, I'm willing if she is.",1,5
Maester Luwin, Bran...,1,5
Bran Stark," The Iron Islands. Sigil - a Kraken. Words - ""We do not sow"".",1,5
Maester Luwin, Lords?,1,5
Bran Stark, The Greyjoys.,1,5
Theon Greyjoy," Famed for their skills at archery, navigation and lovemaking.",1,5
Maester Luwin, And failed rebellions.,1,5
Bran Stark, Sigil - a stag. - A crowned stag now that Robert's King.,1,5
Maester Luwin, Good.,1,5
Bran Stark," Words - ""Ours is the fury"". Lords - the Baratheons.",1,5
Maester Luwin,: Mhmm.,1,5
Maester Luwin,: Mhmm.,1,5
Bran Stark, The Westerlands - sigil - a lion.,1,5
Maester Luwin, Hmm...,1,5
Bran Stark," Words - ""A Lannister always pays his debts.""",1,5
Maester Luwin," No. A common saying, but not their official motto.",1,5
Bran Stark, Lords - the Lannisters.,1,5
Maester Luwin, We're still on their words.,1,5
Bran Stark, I don't know them.,1,5
Maester Luwin, You do know them. Think.,1,5
Bran Stark," ""Unbowed, unbent, unbroken"".",1,5
Maester Luwin,That's House Martell.,1,5
Bran Stark," ""Righteous in wrath"".",1,5
Maester Luwin, House Hornwood.,1,5
Bran Stark," ""Family, duty, honor"".",1,5
Maester Luwin,Those are Tully words... Your mother's. Are we playing a game?,1,5
Bran Stark," ""Family, duty, honor""... Is that the right order?",1,5
Maester Luwin,You know it is.,1,5
Bran Stark, Family comes first?,1,5
Maester Luwin, Your mother had to leave Winterfell to protect the family.,1,5
Bran Stark," How can she protect the family, if she's not with her family?",1,5
Maester Luwin, Your mother sat by your bed for three weeks while you slept.,1,5
Bran Stark, And then she left!,1,5
Maester Luwin," When you were born, I was the one who pulled you from your mother. I placed you in her arms. From that moment until the moment she dies, she will love you. Absolutely. Fiercely.",1,5
Bran Stark, Why did she leave?,1,5
Maester Luwin," I still can't tell you, but she will be home soon.",1,5
Bran Stark, Do you know where she is now? Today?,1,5
Maester Luwin,"No, I don't.",1,5
Bran Stark, Then how can you promise me she'll be home soon?,1,5
Maester Luwin, Sometimes I worry you're too smart for your own good.,1,5
Bran Stark, I'll never shoot another arrow.,1,5
Maester Luwin, And where is that written?,1,5
Bran Stark, You need legs to work a bow.,1,5
Maester Luwin," Hmm... If the saddle Lord Tyrion designed actually works, you could learn to shoot a bow from horseback.",1,5
Bran Stark, Really?,1,5
Maester Luwin, Dothraki boys learn when they're four years old. Why shouldn't you?,1,5
Theon Greyjoy, Shh... Keep it down. You're not supposed to be inside the castle walls.,1,5
Ros, I thought you were supposed to be an important person around here.,1,5
Theon Greyjoy, Important enough for the likes of you.,1,5
Ros," You're not the only nobleman in my life, you know.",1,5
Theon Greyjoy, Who? the Imp? I'd call him half a nobleman.,1,5
Ros, Jealous?,1,5
Theon Greyjoy, Why should I be jealous?,1,5
Theon Greyjoy, Anyone with a few coppers in his pocket can own you for the night. What's a dwarf like down below? I've always wondered.,1,5
Ros, Might surprise you.,1,5
Theon Greyjoy, Hmm?,1,5
Ros, He's good with his fingers too. And his tongue.,1,5
Theon Greyjoy, Generous tipper. I guess gold is cheap for a Lannister.,1,5
Ros, You are jealous.,1,5
Theon Greyjoy," I'm a Greyjoy. We've been Lords of the Iron Islands for 300 years. There's not a family in Westeros that can look down on us, not even the Lannisters.",1,5
Ros, And what about the Starks?,1,5
Theon Greyjoy, I’ve been Lord Stark’s ward since I was eight years old.,1,5
Ros," A “ward”, that’s a nice word for it. Your father rebelled against King Robert and if he does it again…",1,5
Theon Greyjoy, My father fought for the freedom of his people! What did your father do? Fucked a cook and whelped a whore.,1,5
Ros, You’re a very serious boy.,1,5
Theon Greyjoy, I’m not a boy.,1,5
Ros," Oh, yes you are. A serious boy, with a serious cock.",1,5
Theon Greyjoy, I don’t want to pay for it.,1,5
Ros, Then get yourself a wife.,1,5
Arya Stark, Come on. I'm not gonna hurt you.,1,5
Varys," How is your son, my Lord?",1,5
Eddard Stark, He'll never walk again.,1,5
Varys, But his mind is sound?,1,5
Eddard Stark, So they say.,1,5
Varys,A blessing then. I suffered an early mutilation myself. Some doors close forever... others open in the most unexpected places. May I?,1,5
Varys," If the wrong ears heard what I'm about to tell you, off comes my head. And who would mourn poor Varys then? North or South, they sing no songs for spiders. But there are things you must know. You are the King's Hand and the King is a fool... your friend, I know, but a fool... and doomed unless you save him.",1,5
Eddard Stark, I've been in the capital a month. Why have you waited so long to tell me this?,1,5
Varys, I didn't trust you.,1,5
Eddard Stark, So why do you trust me now?,1,5
Varys," The Queen is not the only one who has been watching you closely. There are few men of honor in the capital. You are one of them. I would like to believe I am another, strange as that may seem.",1,5
Eddard Stark, What sort of doom does the King face?,1,5
Varys," The same sort as Jon Arryn. The tears of Lys, they call it. A rare and costly thing, as clear and tasteless as water. It leaves no trace.",1,5
Eddard Stark, Who gave it to him?,1,5
Varys," Some dear friend, no doubt. But which one? There were many. Lord Arryn was a kind and trusting man. There was one boy... all he was he owed to Jon Arryn.",1,5
Eddard Stark," The squire, Ser Hugh?",1,5
Varys," Pity what happened to him, just when his life seemed to be going so nicely.",1,5
Eddard Stark," If Ser Hugh poisoned him, who paid Ser Hugh?",1,5
Varys, Someone who could afford it.,1,5
Eddard Stark, Jon was a man of peace. He was Hand for 17 years -- 17 good years. Why kill him?,1,5
Varys, He started asking questions.,1,5
Varys, He's found one bastard already. He has the book. The rest will come.,1,5
Illyrio Mopatis," And when he knows the truth, what will he do?",1,5
Varys," The gods alone know. The fools tried to kill his son. What's worse, they botched it. The wolf and the lion will be at each other's throats. We will be at war soon, my friend.",1,5
Illyrio Mopatis," What good is war now? We're not ready. If one Hand can die, why not a second?",1,5
Varys, This Hand is not the other.,1,5
Illyrio Mopatis, We need time. Khal Drogo will not make his move until his son is born. You know how these savages are.,1,5
Varys," ""Delay,"" you say. ""Move fast, "" I reply. This is no longer a game for two players.",1,5
Illyrio Mopatis, It never was.,1,5
Varys, The first to arrive and the last to leave. I admire your industry.,1,5
Petyr Baelish, You do move quietly.,1,5
Varys, We all have our qualities.,1,5
Petyr Baelish, You look a bit lonely today. You should pay a visit to my brothel this evening. First boy is on the house.,1,5
Varys, I think you're mistaking business with pleasure.,1,5
Petyr Baelish," Am I? All those birds that whisper in your ear, such pretty little things. Trust me, we accommodate all inclinations.",1,5
Varys," Oh, I'm sure. Lord Redwyne likes his boys very young, I hear.",1,5
Petyr Baelish," I'm a purveyor of beauty and discretion, both equally important.",1,5
Varys," Though I suppose beauty is a subjective quality, no? Is it true that Ser Marlon of Tumblestone prefers amputees?",1,5
Petyr Baelish, All desires are valid to a man with a full purse.,1,5
Varys, And I heard the most awful rumor about a certain lord with a taste for fresh cadavers. Must be enormously difficult to accommodate that inclination. The logistics alone... to find beautiful corpses before they rot.,1,5
Petyr Baelish," Strictly speaking, such a thing would not be in accordance with the King's laws.",1,5
Varys, Strictly speaking.,1,5
Petyr Baelish," Tell me. Does someone, somewhere, keep your balls in a little box? I've often wondered.",1,5
Varys," Do you know, I have no idea where they are? And we had been so close. But enough about me. How have you been since we last saw each other?",1,5
Petyr Baelish, Since you last saw me or since I last saw you?,1,5
Varys," Now the last time I saw you, you were talking to the Hand of the King.",1,5
Petyr Baelish, Saw me with your own eyes?,1,5
Varys, Eyes I own.,1,5
Petyr Baelish, Council business. We all have so much to discuss with Ned Stark.,1,5
Varys, Everyone's well aware of your enduring fondness for Lord Stark's wife. If the Lannisters were behind the attempt on the Stark boy's life and it was discovered that you helped the Starks come to that conclusion... To think... A simple word to the Queen...,1,5
Petyr Baelish, One shudders at the thought.,1,5
Varys, Oh.,1,5
Petyr Baelish, But you know something? I do believe that I have seen you even more recently than you have seen me.,1,5
Varys, Have you?,1,5
Petyr Baelish," Yes. Earlier today, I distinctly recall seeing you talking to Lord Stark in his chambers.",1,5
Varys, Was that you under the bed?,1,5
Petyr Baelish," And not long after that when I saw you escorting a certain foreign dignitary... Council business? Of course you would have friends from across The Narrow Sea. You're from there yourself, after all. We're friends, aren't we, Lord Varys? I'd like to think we are. So you can imagine my burden, wondering if the King might question my friend's sympathies… To stand at a crossroads where turning left means loyalty to a friend, turning right, loyalty to the realm.",1,5
Varys," Oh, please.",1,5
Petyr Baelish, To find myself in a position where a simple word to the King --,1,5
Renly Baratheon," What are you two conspiring about? Well, whatever it is, you'd best hurry up. My brother is coming.",1,5
Petyr Baelish, To a small council meeting?,1,5
Varys, Disturbing news from far away. Haven't you heard?,1,5
Guard 1, Off with you. No begging.,1,5
Arya Stark, I'm not a beggar. I live here.,1,5
Guard 1, D'you want a smack on your ear to help you with your hearing?,1,5
Arya Stark, I want to see my father.,1,5
Guard 2," I want to fuck the Queen, for all the good it does me.",1,5
Guard 1," You want your father, boy? He's lying on the floor of some tavern, getting pissed on by his friends.",1,5
Arya Stark," My father is Hand of the King! I'm not a boy. I'm Arya Stark of Winterfell and if you lay a hand on me, my father will have both your heads on spikes! Now are you going to let me by or do I need to smack you on the ear to help with your hearing?",1,5
Eddard Stark, You know I had half my guard out searching for you? You promised me this would stop.,1,5
Arya Stark, They said they were going to kill you.,1,5
Eddard Stark, Who did?,1,5
Arya Stark," I didn't see them, but I think one was fat.",1,5
Eddard Stark," Oh, Arya.",1,5
Arya Stark, I'm not lying! They said you found the bastard and the wolves are fighting the lions and the savage... something about the savage.,1,5
Eddard Stark, Where did you hear this?,1,5
Arya Stark," In the dungeons, near the dragon skulls.",1,5
Eddard Stark, What were you doing in the dungeons?,1,5
Arya Stark, Chasing a cat.,1,5
Jory Cassel," Pardon, my Lord. There's a Night's Watchman here begging a word. He says it's urgent.",1,5
Eddard Stark," Your name, friend?",1,5
Yoren," Yoren, if it please. This must be your son. He has the look.",1,5
Arya Stark, I'm a girl!,1,5
Eddard Stark, Did Benjen send you?,1,5
Yoren," No one sent me, my Lord. I'm here to find men for The Wall, see if there's any scum in the dungeons that might be fit for service.",1,5
Eddard Stark," Ah, we'll find recruits for you.",1,5
Yoren," Thank you, my Lord. But that's not why I disturb you now. Your brother, Benjen... his blood runs black, makes him as much my brother as yours. It's for his sake I rode here so hard I damn near killed my horse! There are others riding too. The whole city will know by tomorrow.",1,5
Eddard Stark, Know what?,1,5
Yoren," Best said in private, my Lord.",1,5
Eddard Stark, Go on. We'll talk more later.,1,5
Eddard Stark," Jory, take her safely to her room.",1,5
Jory Cassel," Come along, my Lady. You heard your father.",1,5
Arya Stark, How many guards does my father have?,1,5
Jory Cassel, Here in King's Landing? Fifty.,1,5
Arya Stark," You wouldn't let anyone kill him, would you?",1,5
Jory Cassel," No fear on that count, little Lady.",1,5
Eddard Stark, Well?,1,5
Yoren," It's about your wife, my Lord. She's taken the Imp.",1,5
Vardis Egen," You're far from home, Lady Stark.",1,5
Catelyn Stark, To whom do I speak?,1,5
Vardis Egen," Ser Vardis Egen, Knight of The Vale. Is Lady Arryn expecting your visit?",1,5
Catelyn Stark, There was no time to send word.,1,5
Vardis Egen," May I ask, my Lady, why he is with you?",1,5
Catelyn Stark, That's why there was no time. He is my prisoner.,1,5
Vardis Egen, He doesn't look like a prisoner.,1,5
Catelyn Stark, My sister will decide what he looks like.,1,5
Vardis Egen," Yes, my Lady. She will at that.",1,5
Tyrion Lannister, The Eyrie. They say it's impregnable.,1,5
Bronn, Give me 10 good men and some climbing spikes... I'll impregnate the bitch.,1,5
Tyrion Lannister, I like you.,1,5
Steward," Lord Stark, your presence has been requested in the small council chamber. A meeting has been called.",1,5
Eddard Stark, I need to see the King first -- alone.,1,5
Steward," The King is at the small council meeting, my Lord. He has summoned you.",1,5
Eddard Stark, Is it about my wife?,1,5
Steward," No, my Lord. I believe it concerns Daenerys Targaryen.",1,5
Robert Baratheon, The whore is pregnant.,1,5
Eddard Stark, You're speaking of murdering a child.,1,5
Robert Baratheon," I warned you this would happen. Back in the North, I warned you, but you didn't care to hear. Well, hear it now. I want 'em dead, mother and child both. And that fool, Viserys as well. Is that plain enough for you? I want them both dead.",1,5
Eddard Stark, You will dishonor yourself forever if you do this.,1,5
Robert Baratheon," Honor?! I've got Seven Kingdoms to rule! One King, Seven Kingdoms. Do you think honor keeps them in line? Do you think it's honor that's keeping the peace? It's fear! Fear and blood!",1,5
Eddard Stark, Then we're no better than the Mad King.,1,5
Robert Baratheon," Careful, Ned. Careful now.",1,5
Eddard Stark, You want to assassinate a girl... Because the Spider heard a rumor?,1,5
Varys," No rumor, my Lord. The princess is with child.",1,5
Eddard Stark, Based on whose information?,1,5
Varys, Ser Jorah Mormont. He is serving as adviser to the Targaryens.,1,5
Eddard Stark, Mormont? You bring us the whispers of a traitor half a world away and call it fact?,1,5
Petyr Baelish," Jorah Mormont's a slaver, not a traitor. Small difference, I know, to an honorable man.",1,5
Eddard Stark," He broke the law, betrayed his family, fled our land. We commit murder on the word of this man?",1,5
Robert Baratheon, And if he's right? If she has a son? A Targaryen at the head of a Dothraki army… What then?,1,5
Eddard Stark, The Narrow Sea still lies between us. I'll fear the Dothraki the day they teach their horses to run on water.,1,5
Robert Baratheon, Do nothing? That's your wise advice? Do nothing til our enemies are on our shores? You're my council? Counsel! Speak sense to this honorable fool.,1,5
Varys," I understand your misgivings, my Lord. Truly, I do. It is a terrible thing we must consider, a vile thing. Yet, we who presume to rule must sometimes do vile things for the good of the realm. Should the gods grant Daenerys a son, the realm will bleed.",1,5
Grand Maester Pycelle," I bear this girl no ill will, but should the Dothraki invade, how many innocents will die? How many towns will burn? Is it not wiser, kinder even, that she should die now so that tens of thousands might live?",1,5
Renly Baratheon, We should have had them both killed years ago.,1,5
Petyr Baelish," When you find yourself in bed with an ugly woman, best close your eyes, get it over with. Cut her throat. Be done with it.",1,5
Eddard Stark," I followed you into war - twice, without doubts, without second thoughts. But I will not follow you now. The Robert I grew up with didn't tremble at the shadow of an unborn child.",1,5
Robert Baratheon, She dies.,1,5
Eddard Stark, I will have no part in it.,1,5
Robert Baratheon," You're the King's Hand, Lord Stark. You'll do as I command or I'll find me a Hand who will.",1,5
Eddard Stark, And good luck to him. I thought you were a better man.,1,5
Robert Baratheon," Out! Out, damn you! I'm done with you. Go! Run back to Winterfell! I'll have your head on a spike! I'll put it there myself, you fool! You think you're too good for this? Too proud and honorable? This is a war!",1,5
Eddard Stark, I'll go ahead with my daughters. Get them ready. Do it yourself. Don't ask anyone for help.,1,5
Jory Cassel," Right away, my Lord. Lord Baelish is here for you.",1,5
Petyr Baelish," His Grace went on about you at some length after you took your leave. The word ""treason"" was mentioned.",1,5
Eddard Stark, What can I do for you?,1,5
Petyr Baelish, When do you return to Winterfell?,1,5
Eddard Stark, Why? What do you care?,1,5
Petyr Baelish," If you're still here come nightfall, I'll take you to see the last person Jon Arryn spoke with before falling ill. If that sort of thing still interests you.",1,5
Eddard Stark, I don't have the time.,1,5
Petyr Baelish, It won't take more than an hour. But as you please.,1,5
Eddard Stark, Round up all the men we have and station them outside the girls' chambers. Who are your best two swords?,1,5
Jory Cassel, Heward and Wyl.,1,5
Eddard Stark, Find them and meet me at the stables.,1,5
Lysa Arryn," You bring him here without permission? You pollute my home with his presence? Your aunt has done a bad thing, Robin, a very bad thing. You remember her, don't you? Isn't he beautiful? And strong too. Jon knew it. His last words were, ""the seed is strong."" He wanted everyone to know what a good, strong boy his son would grow up to be. Look at him, the Lord of all the Vale.",1,5
Catelyn Stark," Lysa, you wrote me about the Lannisters, warning me t-",1,5
Lysa Arryn, To stay away from them! Not to bring one here!,1,5
Robin Arryn, Mommy? Is that the bad man?,1,5
Lysa Arryn, It is.,1,5
Robin Arryn, He's little.,1,5
Lysa Arryn, He's Tyrion the Imp of House Lannister. He killed your father. He murdered the Hand of the King!,1,5
Tyrion Lannister, Oh? Did I kill him too? I've been a very busy man.,1,5
Lysa Arryn, You will watch your tongue! These men are Knights of the Vale. Every one of the loved Jon Arryn. Every one of them would die for me.,1,5
Tyrion Lannister," If any harm comes to me, my brother, Jaime, will see that they do.",1,5
Robin Arryn," You can't hurt us! No one can hurt us here! Tell him, mommy! Tell him!",1,5
Lysa Arryn," Shh... Shh... Shh, my sweet boy. He's just trying to frighten us. Lannisters are all liars. No one will hurt my baby.",1,5
Robin Arryn, Mommy... I want to see the bad man fly.,1,5
Lysa Arryn," Perhaps you will, my little love.",1,5
Catelyn Stark, This man is my prisoner. I will not have him harmed.,1,5
Lysa Arryn," Ser Vardis, my sister's guest is weary. Take him down below so he can rest. Introduce him to Mord.",1,5
Mord," You go sleep, dwarf man. Sleep good, little dwarf. man!",1,5
Loras Tyrell, Lord Stark's lucky he still has a head.,1,5
Renly Baratheon," Robert will rant for a few days, but he won't do anything. He adores the man.",1,5
Loras Tyrell, You're jealous.,1,5
Renly Baratheon, Are you sure this won't hurt?,1,5
Loras Tyrell, Only if I slip.,1,5
Renly Baratheon, And you prefer me like this?,1,5
Loras Tyrell, Mhmm.,1,5
Renly Baratheon," If you want hairless, maybe you should find a little boy.",1,5
Loras Tyrell, I want you.,1,5
Renly Baratheon," My brother thinks that anyone who hasn't been to war isn't a man. He treats me as if I'm a spoiled child. Oh, and you're not? Loras Tyrell, the Knight of the Flowers? How many wars have you fought in? Oh, and how much did your father spend on that armor of yours?",1,5
Loras Tyrell, Hold still.,1,5
Renly Baratheon," All I ever hear from Robert and Stannis is how I'm not tough enough, how I squirm at the sight of blood.",1,5
Loras Tyrell, You did vomit when that boy's eye was knocked out in the mêlée.,1,5
Renly Baratheon,His eye was dangling out of the damn socket!,1,5
Loras Tyrell, He shouldn't have entered the mêlée if he didn't know how to fight.,1,5
Renly Baratheon, Easy for you to say. Not everyone is such a gifted swordsman.,1,5
Loras Tyrell, It's not a gift. No one gave it to me. I'm good because I work at it -- every day of my life since I could hold a stick.,1,5
Renly Baratheon," I could work at fighting all day, every day, and still never be as good as you.",1,5
Loras Tyrell," Yes well, I guess we'll never know.",1,5
Renly Baratheon, Everywhere?,1,5
Loras Tyrell, Everywhere. So how did it end up? The Targaryen girl will die?,1,5
Renly Baratheon," It needs to be done, unpleasant as it is. Robert's rather tasteless about it. Every time he talks about killing her, I swear the table rises six inches.",1,5
Loras Tyrell, It's a shame he can't muster the same enthusiasm for his wife.,1,5
Renly Baratheon," He does have a deep, abiding lust for her money. You have to give it to the Lannisters, they may be the most pompous, ponderous cunts the gods ever suffered to walk the world, but they do have outrageous amounts of money.",1,5
Loras Tyrell, I have an outrageous amount of money.,1,5
Renly Baratheon, Not as much as the Lannisters.,1,5
Loras Tyrell, But a lot more than you.,1,5
Renly Baratheon," Robert's threatening to take me hunting with him. Last time we were out there for two weeks, tramping through the trees in the rain, day after day. All so he can stick his spear into something's flesh! Oh. but Robert loves his killing. And he's the King.",1,5
Loras Tyrell, Hmm... How did that ever happen?,1,5
Renly Baratheon, Because he loves his killing and he used to be good at it.,1,5
Loras Tyrell, Do you know who should be King?,1,5
Renly Baratheon, Be serious.,1,5
Loras Tyrell," I am. My father could be your bank. I've never fought in a war before, but I'd fight for you.",1,5
Renly Baratheon, I'm fourth in line.,1,5
Loras Tyrell, And where was Robert in the line of royal succession? Joffrey is a monster. Tommen is eight.,1,5
Renly Baratheon, Stannis?,1,5
Loras Tyrell, Stannis has the personality of a lobster.,1,5
Renly Baratheon, He's still my older brother.,1,5
Renly Baratheon, What are you doing?!,1,5
Loras Tyrell, Look at it.,1,5
Renly Baratheon, You cut me!,1,5
Loras Tyrell," It's just blood. We've all got it in us. Sometimes a little spills. If you become King, you're going to see a lot of this. You need to get used to it. Go on. Look. People love you. They love to serve you because you're kind to them. They want to be near you.",1,5
Loras Tyrell," You're willing to do what needs to be done, but you don't gloat over it. You don't love killing. Where is it written that power is the sole province of the worst? That thrones are only made for the hated and the feared. You would be a wonderful King.",1,5
Cersei Baratheon, I'm sorry your marriage to Ned Stark didn't work out. You seemed so good together.,1,5
Robert Baratheon, I'm glad I could do something to make you happy.,1,5
Cersei Baratheon," Without a Hand, everything will fall to pieces.",1,5
Robert Baratheon, I suppose this is where you tell me to give the job to your brother Jaime.,1,5
Cersei Baratheon, No. He's not serious enough. I'll say this for Ned Stark - he's serious enough. Was it really worth it? Losing him this way?,1,5
Robert Baratheon," I don't know. But I do know this, if the Targaryen girl convinces her horse-lord husband to invade and the Dothraki horde crosses The Narrow Sea... We won't be able to stop them.",1,5
Cersei Baratheon, The Dothraki don't sail. Every child knows that. They don't have discipline. They don't have armor. They don't have siege weapons.,1,5
Robert Baratheon," It's a neat little trick you do, you move your lips and your father's voice comes out.",1,5
Cersei Baratheon, Is my father wrong?,1,5
Robert Baratheon," Let's say Viserys Targaryen lands with forty thousand Dothraki screamers at his back. We hole up in our castles, a wise move. Only a fool would meet the Dothraki in an open field. They leave us in our castles. They go from town to town, looting and burning, killing every man who can't hide behind a stone wall, stealing all our crops and livestock, enslaving all our women and children. How long do the people of the Seven Kingdoms stand behind their absentee King, their cowardly King hiding behind high walls? When do the people decide that Viserys Targaryen is the rightful monarch after all.",1,5
Cersei Baratheon, We still outnumber them.,1,5
Robert Baratheon, Which is the bigger number -- five or one?,1,5
Cersei Baratheon, Five.,1,5
Robert Baratheon," Five... one. One army, a real army, united behind one leader with one purpose. Our purpose died with the Mad King. Now we've got as many armies as there are men with gold in their purse. And everybody wants something different. Your father wants to own the world. Ned Stark wants to run away and bury his head in the snow.",1,5
Cersei Baratheon, What do you want?,1,5
Robert Baratheon," We haven't had a real fight in nine years. Back-stabbing doesn't prepare you for a fight. And that's all the realm is now, back-stabbing and scheming and arse-licking and money-grubbing. Sometimes I don't know what holds it together.",1,5
Cersei Baratheon, Our marriage.,1,5
Robert Baratheon," Ah, so here we sit, seventeen years later, holding it all together. Don't you get tired?",1,5
Cersei Baratheon, Every day.,1,5
Robert Baratheon, How long can hate hold a thing together?,1,5
Cersei Baratheon," Well, seventeen years is quite a long time.",1,5
Robert Baratheon," Yes, it is.",1,5
Cersei Baratheon," Yes, it tis. What was she like?",1,5
Robert Baratheon," You've never asked about her, not once. Why not?",1,5
Cersei Baratheon," At first, just saying her name, even in private felt like I was breathing life back into her. I thought if I didn't talk about her, she'd just fade away for you. When I realized that wasn't going to happen, I refused to ask out of spite. I didn't want to give you the satisfaction of thinking I cared enough to ask. And eventually it became clear that my spite didn't mean anything to you, as far as I could tell, you actually enjoyed it.",1,5
Robert Baratheon, So why now?,1,5
Cersei Baratheon, What harm could Lyanna Stark's ghost do to either of us that we haven't done to each other a hundred times over?,1,5
Robert Baratheon," You want to know the horrible truth? I can't even remember what she looked like. I only know she was the one thing I ever wanted... Someone took her away from me, and Seven Kingdoms couldn't fill the hole she left behind.",1,5
Cersei Baratheon," I felt something for you once, you know?",1,5
Robert Baratheon, I know.,1,5
Cersei Baratheon," Even after we lost our first boy -- for quite a while, actually. Was it ever possible for us? Was there ever a time, ever a... moment?",1,5
Robert Baratheon, No. Does that make you feel better or worse?,1,5
Cersei Baratheon, It doesn't make me feel anything.,1,5
Mhaegen," She looks like him, don't she, my Lord? She has his nose, his black hair.",1,5
Eddard Stark, Aye.,1,5
Mhaegen," Tell him when you see him, my Lord. If it please you... Tell him how beautiful she is.",1,5
Eddard Stark, I will.,1,5
Mhaegen," And tell him I've been with no one else. I swear it, my Lord, by the old gods and new. I don't want no jewels or nothing, just him. The King was always good to me.",1,5
Eddard Stark," When Jon Arryn came to visit you, what did he want?",1,5
Mhaegen," He wasn't that sort of man, my Lord. He just wanted to know if the child was happy, healthy.",1,5
Eddard Stark, She looks healthy enough to me. The girl shall want for nothing.,1,5
Petyr Baelish," Brothels make a much better investment than ship, I've found. Whores rarely sink.",1,5
Eddard Stark, What do you know of King Robert's bastards?,1,5
Petyr Baelish," Well, he has more than you, for a start.",1,5
Eddard Stark, How many?,1,5
Petyr Baelish," Does it matter? If you fuck enough women, some of them will give you presents.",1,5
Eddard Stark, And Jon Arryn tracked them all down. Why?,1,5
Petyr Baelish, He was the King's Hand. Perhaps Robert wanted them looked after. He was overcome with fatherly love.,1,5
Eddard Stark, Come.,1,5
Eddard Stark, Jory!,1,5
Jory Cassel, My Lord.,1,5
Jaime Lannister, Such a small pack of wolves.,1,5
Jory Cassel," Stay back, Ser! This is the Hand of the King!",1,5
Jaime Lannister, Was!... the Hand of the King. Now I'm not sure what he is... Lord of somewhere very far away.,1,5
Petyr Baelish," What's the meaning of this, Lannister?",1,5
Jaime Lannister," Get back inside where it's safe. I'm looking for my brother. You remember my brother, don't you, Lord Stark? Blond hair, sharp tongue, short man.",1,5
Eddard Stark, I remember him well.,1,5
Jaime Lannister," It seems he had some trouble on the road. You wouldn't know what happened to him, would you?",1,5
Eddard Stark,He was taken at my command to answer for his crimes.,1,5
Petyr Baelish, My Lords! I'll bring the City Watch!,1,5
Jaime Lannister," Come, Stark. I'd rather you die sword in hand.",1,5
Jory Cassel, If you threaten my Lord again...,1,5
Jaime Lannister," Threaten? As in, ""I'm going to open your Lord from balls to brains and see what Starks are made of”?",1,5
Eddard Stark," You kill me, your brother's a dead man.",1,5
Jaime Lannister, You're right. Take him alive! Kill his men!,1,5
Jaime Lannister," My brother, Lord Stark... We want him back.",1,5
Eddard Stark," Your pardon, your Grace.",1,6
Cersei Baratheon, Do you know what your wife has done?,1,6
Eddard Stark, She did nothing I did not command.,1,6
Robert Baratheon, Who’d have thought she had it in her?,1,6
Cersei Baratheon, By what right dare you lay hands on my blood?,1,6
Eddard Stark, I am the King’s Hand -,1,6
Cersei Baratheon, You were the King’s Hand!,1,6
Eddard Stark, - trying to keep the peace -,1,6
Cersei Baratheon, You shall now be held accountable.,1,6
Robert Baratheon," Oh, will both of you shut your mouths? Catelyn will release Tyrion and you’ll make your peace with Jaime.",1,6
Eddard Stark, He butchered my men.,1,6
Cersei Baratheon, Lord Stark was returning drunk from a brothel when his men attacked Jaime.,1,6
Robert Baratheon," Quiet, woman.",1,6
Eddard Stark, Jaime has fled the city. Give me leave to bring him back to justice.,1,6
Cersei Baratheon, I took you for a king.,1,6
Robert Baratheon, Hold your tongue.,1,6
Cersei Baratheon, He’s attacked my brother and abducted the other. I should wear the armor and you the gown.,1,6
Cersei Baratheon, I shall wear this like a badge of honor.,1,6
Robert Baratheon, Wear it in silence or I’ll honor you again.,1,6
Robert Baratheon, See what she does to me? My loving wife. I should not have hit her. That was not… That was not kingly.,1,6
Eddard Stark, If we don’t act… there will be a war.,1,6
Robert Baratheon," So tell your wife to return that little shit of an Imp to King’s Landing. She’s had her fun, now put an end to it. You hear me? Send a raven and put an end to it.",1,6
Eddard Stark, And what about Jaime Lannister? What about Jaime?,1,6
Robert Baratheon," I’m half a kingdom in debt to his bloody father. I don’t know what happened between you and those yellow-haired shits. I don’t want to know. This is what matters - I can’t rule the kingdoms if the Starks and the Lannisters are at each other’s throats, so enough!",1,6
Eddard Stark," As you command your Grace. With your leave, I will return to Winterfell and set matters straight.",1,6
Robert Baratheon," Piss on that! Send a raven. I want you to stay. I’m the king, I get what I want… I never loved my brothers. A sad thing for a man to admit, but it’s true. You were the brother I chose. We’ll talk when I return from the hunt.",1,6
Eddard Stark, The hunt?,1,6
Robert Baratheon, Killing things clears my head. You’ll have to sit on the throne while I’m away. You’ll hate it more than I do.,1,6
Eddard Stark, The Targaryen girl -,1,6
Robert Baratheon," Seven hells! Don’t start with her again! The girl will die and I’ll hear no more of it. Put on the badge. And if you ever take it off again, I swear to the Mother I’ll pin the damn thing on Jaime Lannister.",1,6
Irri, Khaleesi?,1,6
Irri," Oh, Khaleesi!",1,6
Daenerys Targaryen, You’re hurt.,1,6
Robb Stark, Not too fast.,1,6
Bran Stark," Come on, Dancer. (to his horse)",1,6
Theon Greyjoy, When are you gonna tell him?,1,6
Robb Stark, Not now.,1,6
Theon Greyjoy, Blood for blood. You need to make the Lannisters to pay for Jory and the others.,1,6
Robb Stark, You’re talking about war.,1,6
Theon Greyjoy, I’m talking about justice.,1,6
Robb Stark, Only the Lord of Winterfell can call in the bannermen and raise an army.,1,6
Theon Greyjoy, A Lannister put his spear through your father’s leg. The Kingslayer rides to Casterly Rock where no one can touch -,1,6
Robb Stark,You want me to march on Casterly Rock?!,1,6
Theon Greyjoy, You’re not a boy anymore. They attacked your father. They’ve already started the war. It’s your duty to represent your House when your father can’t.,1,6
Robb Stark," And it’s not your duty, because it’s not your House.",1,6
Robb Stark, Where’s Bran?,1,6
Theon Greyjoy, I don’t know. It’s not my House.,1,6
Bran Stark, Robb?,1,6
Osha, All alone in the deep dark woods.,1,6
Bran Stark," I’m not alone, my brother is with me.",1,6
Wildling, I don’t see him. Got him hidden under your cloak?,1,6
Osha," Oh, that’s a pretty pin. Silver.",1,6
Wildling, We’ll take the pin. And the horse. Get down… Be quick about it.,1,6
Bran Stark," I can’t. The saddle, the straps.",1,6
Wildling, What’s wrong with you? You some kind of cripple?,1,6
Bran Stark," I’m Brandon Stark of Winterfell and if you don’t let me be, I’ll have you all killed!",1,6
Wildling 2, Cut his little cock off and stuff it in his mouth.,1,6
Osha, the boy’s worth nothing dead. Benjen Stark’s own blood. Think what Mance would give us.,1,6
Wildling, Piss on Mance rayder and piss on the North. We’re going as far south as south goes. There ain’t no white walkers down in Dorne.,1,6
Robb Stark, Drop the knife. Let him go and I’ll let you live.,1,6
Bran Stark, Robb!,1,6
Wildling, Shut up! Drop the blade!,1,6
Bran Stark," No, don’t.",1,6
Wildling, Do it.,1,6
Robb Stark, Are you all right?,1,6
Bran Stark," Yes, it doesn’t hurt.",1,6
Theon Greyjoy," Tough little lad. In the Iron Islands, you’re not a man until you’ve killed your first enemy. Well done.",1,6
Robb Stark, Have you lost your mind? What if you’d missed?,1,6
Theon Greyjoy, He would have killed you and cut Bran’s throat.,1,6
Robb Stark, You don’t have the right -,1,6
Theon Greyjoy," To what, to save your brother’s life? It was the only thing to do, so I did it.",1,6
Robb Stark, What about her?,1,6
Osha," Give me my life, my lord, and I’m yours.",1,6
Robb Stark, We’ll keep her alive.,1,6
Tyrion Lannister, Mord! Turnkey! Mord! Mord!,1,6
Mord, Dwarf man making noise!,1,6
Tyrion Lannister, How would you like to be rich?,1,6
Mord, Dwarf man still making noise.,1,6
Tyrion Lannister," My family is rich. We have gold, lots of gold. I’m prepared to give you lots of gold.",1,6
Mord, No gold!,1,6
Tyrion Lannister," Well, I don’t have it here.",1,6
Mord, No gold! Fuck off.,1,6
Arya Stark, I don’t want to practice today.,1,6
Syrio Forel, No?,1,6
Arya Stark, They killed Jory. My father is hurt. I don’t care about stupid wooden swords.,1,6
Syrio Forel, You are troubled.,1,6
Arya Stark, Yes -,1,6
Syrio Forel," Good! Trouble is the perfect time for training. When you are dancing in the meadow with your dolls and kittens, this is not when fighting happens.",1,6
Arya Stark, I don’t like dolls and k -,1,6
Syrio Forel, You’re not here. You’re with your trouble. If you’re with your trouble when fighting happens…,1,6
Syrio Forel," … More trouble for you. Just so… How can you be quick as a snake, or as quiet as a shadow, when you are somewhere else? You are fearing for your father, hmm? That is right. Do you pray to the gods?",1,6
Syrio Forel, The old and the new.,1,6
Syrio Forel, There is only one god. And his name is death. And there is only one thing we say to death - “Not today.”,1,6
Viserys Targaryen, She has to eat a whole heart? I hope that wasn’t my horse.,1,6
Jorah Mormont, She’s doing well.,1,6
Viserys Targaryen, She’ll never keep it down.,1,6
Viserys Targaryen, Tell me what she is saying.,1,6
Jorah Mormont, “The prince is riding. I have heard the thunder of the hooves. Swift as the wind he rides. His enemies will cower before him… and their wives will weep tears of blood.”,1,6
Jorah Mormont, She’s going to have a boy.,1,6
Viserys Targaryen, He won’t be a real Targaryen. He won’t be a true dragon.,1,6
Jora," “The stallion who mounts the world.” The stallion, is the khal of khals. He shall unite the people into a single khalasar. All the people of the world will be his herd.",1,6
Daenerys Targaryen, A prince rides inside me! And he shall be called Rhaego!,1,6
Viserys Targaryen, They love her.,1,6
Jorah Mormont, She truly is a queen today.,1,6
Jorah Mormont, Don’t let them see you carrying a sword in Vaes Dothrak. You know the law.,1,6
Viserys Targaryen, It’s not my law.,1,6
Jorah Mormont, They don’t belong to you.,1,6
Viserys Targaryen, Whatever is hers is also mine.,1,6
Jorah Mormont," Once, perhaps.",1,6
Viserys Targaryen," If I sell one egg, I’ll have enough to buy a ship. Two eggs - a ship and an army.",1,6
Jorah Mormont, And you have all three.,1,6
Viserys Targaryen," I need a large army… I’m the last hope of a dynasty, Mormont. The greatest dynasty this world has ever seen, on my shoulders since I was five years old and no one has ever given me what they gave to her in that tent. Never. Not a piece of it… How can I carry what I need to carry without it? Hmm? Who can rule without wealth, or fear, or love? Oh, you stand there, all nobility and honor. You don’t think I see you looking at my little sister, hmm? Don’t think I know what you want? I don’t care. You can have her. She can be queen of the savages and dine on the finest bloody horseparts, and you can dine on whichever parts of her you like. But let me go.",1,6
Jorah Mormont," You can go, but you can’t have the eggs.",1,6
Viserys Targaryen, You swore an oath to me. Does loyalty mean nothing to you?,1,6
Jorah Mormont, It means everything to me.,1,6
Viserys Targaryen, And yet here you stand?,1,6
Jorah Mormont, And here I stand.,1,6
Tyrion Lannister, Mord! Mord! Mord! Mord! Mord!,1,6
Mord, Noise again!,1,6
Tyrion Lannister, About the gold -,1,6
Mord, No gold!,1,6
Tyrion Lannister," Listen to me! Listen to me! Sometimes possession… is an abstract concept. When they captured me they took my purse, but the gold is still mine.",1,6
Mord, Where?,1,6
Tyrion Lannister," Where? I don’t know where, but when they free me -",1,6
Mord, You want free? Go be free. (points out of the skycell),1,6
Tyrion Lannister," Have you ever heard the phrase “Rich as a Lannister”? Of course you have. You’re a smart man. You know who the Lannisters are. I am a Lannister. Tyrion, son of Tywin! And of course, you have also heard the phrase, “a Lannister always pays his debts.” If you deliver a message from me to Lady Arryn, I will be in your debt. I will owe you gold. If you deliver the message and I live, which I very much intend to do.",1,6
Mord, What message?,1,6
Tyrion Lannister, Tell her I wish to confess my crimes.,1,6
Lysa Arryn, You wish to confess your crimes?,1,6
Tyrion Lannister," Yes, my lady. I do, my lady.",1,6
Lysa Arryn," Skycells always break them. Speak, Imp. Meet your gods as an honest man.",1,6
Tyrion Lannister," Where do I begin, my lords and ladies? I’m a vile man, I confess it. My crimes and sins are beyond counting. I have lied and cheated, gambled and whored. I’m not particularly good at violence, but I’m good at convincing others to do violence for me. You want specifics, I suppose. When I was seven, I saw a servant girl bathing in the river. I stole her robe. She was forced to return to the castle, naked and in tears. I close my eyes, I can still see her tits bouncing. When I was ten, I stuffed my uncle’s boots with goatshit. When confronted with my crime, I blamed a squire. Poor boy was flogged and… I escaped justice. When I was twelve, I milked my eel into a pot of turtle stew. I flogged the one-eyed snake. I skinned my sausage. I made the bald man cry into the turtle stew, which I do believe my sister ate. At least I hope she did. I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel -",1,6
Lysa Arryn, Silence!,1,6
Robin Arryn,What happened next?!,1,6
Lysa Arryn, What do you think you’re doing?,1,6
Tyrion Lannister, Confessing my crimes.,1,6
Catelyn Stark," Lord Tyrion, you are accused of hiring a man to slay my son Bran in his bed, and of conspiring to murder my sister’s husband; Lord Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King.",1,6
Tyrion Lannister," Oh, I’m very sorry. I don’t know anything about all that.",1,6
Lysa Arryn," You’ve had your little joke. I trust you enjoyed it. Mord, take him back to the dungeon. But this time find a smaller cell, with a steeper floor.",1,6
Tyrion Lannister," Is this how justice is done in the Vale? you accuse me of crimes, I deny them, so you throw me in a cell to freeze and starve? Where is the King’s Justice? I’m accused and demand a trial.",1,6
Lysa Arryn," If you’re tried and found guilty, then by the king’s own laws you will pay with your life.",1,6
Tyrion Lannister, I understand the law.,1,6
Lysa Arryn, We have no executioner in the Eyrie. Life is more elegant here. Open the Moon Door.,1,6
Lysa Arryn," You want a trial, my Lord Lannister. Very well. My son will listen to whatever you have to say, and you will hear his judgement. Then you will leave, by one door or the other.",1,6
Tyrion Lannister, No need to bother Lord Robin. I demand a trial by combat.,1,6
Lysa Arryn, You have that right.,1,6
Knight 1," My lady, I beg the honor. Let me be your champion.",1,6
Knight 2, The honor should be mine. For the love I bore your lord husband let me avenge his death.,1,6
Knight 3," I’ll fight for you, my Lady.",1,6
Knight 4, It’ll be my honor.,1,6
Knight 5, The honor should be mine.,1,6
Robin Arryn, Make the bad man fly!,1,6
Lysa Arryn, Ser Vardis… You’re quiet. Did you want to avenge my husband?,1,6
Ser Vardis," With all my heart, my Lady. But the Imp is half my size. It would be shameful to slaughter such a man and call it justice.",1,6
Tyrion Lannister, Agreed.,1,6
Lysa Arryn, You demanded a trial by combat.,1,6
Tyrion Lannister," Now I demand a champion. I have that right, same as you.",1,6
Ser Vardis," My Lady, I would gladly fight the Imp’s champion for you.",1,6
Tyrion Lannister," I wouldn’t be too glad, ser. I name my brother, Jaime Lannister.",1,6
Lysa Arryn, The Kingslayer is hundreds of miles from here.,1,6
Tyrion Lannister," Send a raven for him, I’m happy to wait.",1,6
Lysa Arryn, The trial will be today.,1,6
Tyrion Lannister, Do I have a volunteer?,1,6
Tyrion Lannister, Anyone?... Anyone?,1,6
Lysa Arryn, I think that we can assume that no one is willing -,1,6
Bronn, I’ll stand for the dwarf.,1,6
Lancel Lannister," More wine, your Grace?",1,6
Robert Baratheon," Oh, what was I saying?",1,6
Renly Baratheon, A simpler time.,1,6
Robert Baratheon," It was! It was. You’re too young to remember. Wasn’t it, Selmy?",1,6
Barriston," It was, your Grace.",1,6
Robert Baratheon," The enemy was right there in the open, vicious as you like, all but sending you a bloody invitation. Nothing like today.",1,6
Renly Baratheon, Sounds exhilarating.,1,6
Robert Baratheon," Exhilarating, yes. Not as exhilarating as those balls and masquerades you like to throw. (laughs) You ever fucked a Riverlands girl?",1,6
Renly Baratheon," Once, I think.",1,6
Robert Baratheon," You think? I think you’d remember. Back in our day, you weren’t a real man until you fucked a girl from each of the Seven Kingdoms and the Riverlands. We called it “making the eight.”",1,6
Renly Baratheon, Those were some lucky girls.,1,6
Robert Baratheon," You ever make the eight, Barristan?",1,6
Barristan Selmy," I don’t believe so, your Grace.",1,6
Robert Baratheon, (laughs) Those were the days!,1,6
Renly Baratheon," What days were those? The ones where half of Westeros fought the other half and millions died? Or before that, when the Mad King slaughtered women and babies because the voices in his head told him they deserved it? Or way before that when dragons burned whole cities to the ground?",1,6
Robert Baratheon," Easy, boy. You might be my brother, but you’re speaking to the King.",1,6
Renly Baratheon, I suppose it was all rather heroic. If you were drunk enough and had some poor Riverlands whore to shove your price inside and “make the eight.”,1,6
Lancel Lannister," More wine, your Grace?",1,6
Man," They burned most everything in the Riverlands, our fields, our granaries, our homes. They took our women and then they took ‘em again. When they was done, they butchered them as if they was animals. They covered our children in pitch and lit them on fire.",1,6
Grand Maester Pycelle," Brigands, most likely.",1,6
Man," They weren’t thieves, they didn’t steal nothing. They even left something behind, your Grace.",1,6
Grand Maester Pycelle," It’s the King’s Hand you’re addressing, not the king. The king is hunting.",1,6
Petyr Baelish, Fish. The sigil of House Tully. (whispers to Ned) Isn’t that your wife’s House - Tully - my Lord Hand?,1,6
Eddard Stark," These men, were they flying a sigil? … A banner.",1,6
Man," None, your… Hand. The one who was leading them… Taller by a foot than any man I’ve ever met, saw him cut the blacksmith, saw him take the head off a horse with a single swing of his sword.",1,6
Petyr Baelish, (whisper) That sounds like someone we know. The Mountain.,1,6
Eddard Stark, You’re describing Ser Gregor Clegane.,1,6
Grand Maester Pycelle, Why should Ser Gregor turn brigand? The man is an anointed knight.,1,6
Petyr Baelish, I’ve heard him called “Tywin Lannister’s mad dog.” I’m sure you have as well. (whispering to Ned) Can you think of any reason the Lannisters might possibly have for being angry with your wife?,1,6
Grand Maester Pycelle," If the Lannisters were to order attacks on villages under the king’s protection, it would be -",1,6
Petyr Baelish, It would be almost as brazen as attacking the Hand of the King in the streets of the capital.,1,6
Grand Maester Pycelle, Wel…,1,6
Eddard Stark," I cannot give you back your homes or restore your dead to life. But perhaps I can give you justice in the name of our king, Robert. Lord Beric Dondarrion.",1,6
Eddard Stark, You shall have the command. Assemble 100 men and ride to Ser Gregor’s keep.,1,6
Beric Dondarrion, As you command.,1,6
Eddard Stark," In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, the First of his Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, I charge you to bring the king’s justice to the false knight Gregor Clegane and all those who shared in his crimes. I denounce him and attaint him. I strip him of all ranks and titles of all lands and holdings, and sentence him to death.",1,6
Grand Maester Pycelle, My lord… This… This is a drastic action. It would be better to wait for King Robert’s return.,1,6
Eddard Stark, Grand Maester Pycelle.,1,6
Grand Maester Pycelle, My Lord.,1,6
Eddard Stark," Send a raven to Casterly Rock. Inform Tywin Lannister that he has been summoned to court to answer for the crimes of his bannermen. He will arrive within the fortnight, or be branded an enemy of the crown and a traitor to the realm.",1,6
Petyr Baelish," A bold move, my Lord, and admirable. But is it wise to yank the lion’s tail? Tywin Lannister is the richest man in all the Seven Kingdoms. Gold wins wars, not soldiers.",1,6
Eddard Stark, Then how come Robert is king and not Tywin Lannister?,1,6
Robin Arryn, Is it over?,1,6
Lysa Arryn, You don’t fight with honor!,1,6
Bronn, No. He did.,1,6
Robin Arryn, Can I make the little man fly now?,1,6
Tyrion Lannister, Not this little man. This little man is going home. I believe you have something of mine.,1,6
Tyrion Lannister, A Lannister always pays his debts.,1,6
Mordane, You wear your hair like a real southern lady now.,1,6
Sansa Stark," Well, why shouldn’t I? We’re in the south.",1,6
Mordane, It’s important to remember where you come from. I’m not sure your mother would like these new styles.,1,6
Sansa Stark, My mother isn’t from the North.,1,6
Mordane, I’m aware of that.,1,6
Sansa Stark, Why do you care? Do you even have hair under there?,1,6
Mordane, Yes. I have hair.,1,6
Sansa Stark, I’ve never seen it.,1,6
Mordane, Would you like to?,1,6
Sansa Stark," No. Where are you from anyway, the north or the south?",1,6
Mordane, I come from a very small village in -,1,6
Sansa Stark," Oh, wait. I just realized… I don’t care.",1,6
Mordane, Sansa -,1,6
Sansa Stark, Septa.,1,6
Mordane, Now you are being rude.,1,6
Mordane, My prince.,1,6
Sansa Stark, My prince.,1,6
Joffrey Baratheon, My lady. I fear I have behaved monstrously the past few weeks. With your permission?,1,6
Sansa Stark, It’s beautiful. Like the one your mother wears.,1,6
Joffrey Baratheon," You’ll be queen one day, it’s only fitting that you should look the part. Will you forgive me for my rudeness?",1,6
Sansa Stark, There’s nothing to forgive.,1,6

Greatjon Umber, Expect nothing of Walder Frey and you'll never be surprised. Look.,1,9
Robb Stark, Father rots in a dungeon. How long before they take his head? We need to cross the Trident and we need to do it now.,1,9
Theon Greyjoy, Just march up to his gates and tell him you're crossing. We've got five times his numbers. You can take the Twins if you have to.,1,9
Greatjon Umber, Not in time. Tywin Lannister marches north as we speak.,1,9
Catelyn Stark," The Freys have held the crossing for 600 years, and for 600 years they have never failed to exact their toll.",1,9
Robb Stark, Have my horse saddled and ready.,1,9
Greatjon Umber, Enter the Twins alone and he'll sell you to the Lannisters as he likes.,1,9
Theon Greyjoy, Or throw you in a dungeon. Or slit your throat.,1,9
Robb Stark," My father would do whatever it took to secure our crossing. Whatever it took. lf l'm going to lead this army, l can't have other men doing my bargaining for me.",1,9
Catelyn Stark, l agree. l'll go.,1,9
Everyone, You can't!,1,9
Catelyn Stark, l have known Lord Walder since l was a girl. He would never harm me.,1,9
Greatjon Umber, Unless there was a profit in it.,1,9
Walder Frey, What do you want?,1,9
Catelyn Stark," lt is a great pleasure to see you again after so many years, my lord.",1,9
Walder Frey," Oh, spare me. Your boy's too proud to come before me himself. What am l supposed to do with you?",1,9
Stevron Frey," Father, you forget yourself. Lady Stark is –",1,9
Walder Frey," Who asked you? You're not Lord Frey yet, not until l die. Do l look dead to you?",1,9
Ryger Rivers," Father, please –",1,9
Walder Frey," l need lessons in courtesy from you, bastard? Your mother would still be a milkmaid if l hadn't squirted you into her belly.",1,9
Catelyn Stark, ls there somewhere we can talk?,1,9
Walder Frey, We're talking right now. Fine. Out! All of you!,1,9
Catelyn Stark, l'm sure she will give you many sons.,1,9
Walder Frey, Huh. Your father didn't come to the wedding.,1,9
Catelyn Stark," He is quite ill, my lord.",1,9
Walder Frey," Huh. Didn't come to the last one, either. Or the one before that. Your family has always pissed on me.",1,9
Catelyn Stark," My lord, l –",1,9
Walder Frey, Don't deny it. You know it's true. The fine Lord Tully would never marry any of his children to mine.,1,9
Catelyn Stark, l'm sure there were reasons –,1,9
Walder Frey, l didn't need reasons. l needed to get rid of sons and daughters. You see how they pile up? Why are you here?,1,9
Catelyn Stark," To ask you to open your gates, my lord, so my son and his bannermen may cross the Trident and be on their way.",1,9
Walder Frey, Why should l let him?,1,9
Catelyn Stark," lf you could climb your own battlements, you would see that he has 20,000 men outside your walls.",1,9
Walder Frey," There will be 20,000 corpses when Tywin Lannister gets here. Don't try and frighten me, Lady Stark. Your husband's in a cell beneath the Red Keep and your son's got no fur to keep his balls warm.",1,9
Catelyn Stark, You swore an oath to my father.,1,9
Walder Frey," Oh, yes, l said some words. And l swore oaths to the crown too, if l remember right. Joffrey's king now, which makes your boy and his corpses-to-be nothing but rebels, it seems to me. lf l had the sense the gods gave a fish, l'd hand you both over to the Lannisters.",1,9
Catelyn Stark, Why don't you?,1,9
Walder Frey," Stark, Tully, Lannister, Baratheon. Give me one good reason why l should waste a single thought on any of you?",1,9
Voices outside, And engage!,1,9
Jeor Mormont, When does Aemon think you'll be able to use that hand?,1,9
Jon Snow," Soon, he says.",1,9
Jeor Mormont," Good. You'll be ready for this, then. l thought a wolf was more appropriate for you than a bear so l had a new pommel made. lt's called Longclaw. Works as well for a wolf as a bear, l think.",1,9
Jon Snow, This is Valyrian steel.,1,9
Jeor Mormont," lt was my father's sword, his father before him. The Mormonts have carried it for five centuries. lt was meant for my son Jorah. He brought dishonor to our House, but he had the grace to leave the sword before he fled from Westeros.",1,9
Jon Snow," My lord, you honor me, but l can't –",1,9
Jeor Mormont," Oh, you can. And you will. l wouldn't be standing here if it wasn't for you and your beast. A bloody dead man tried to kill me, so you'll take it. l'll hear no more about it. ls that understood?",1,9
Jon Snow," Yes, my lord.",1,9
Jeor Mormont," Right. Now, don't think this means l approve of this nonsense with you and Alliser Thorne. That's a man's sword. lt'll take a man to wield it.",1,9
Jon Snow, l'll apologize to Ser Alliser tonight.,1,9
Jeor Mormont," No, you won't. l sent him to King's Landing yesterday. The hand that your wolf tore off that thing's wrist – l've ordered Thorne to lay it at the feet of this boy king. That should get young Joffrey's attention. And it, uh, puts a thousand leagues between you and Thorne. Now go and put your sword somewhere safe and bring me my supper.",1,9
Jon Snow," Yes, my lord.",1,9
Unidentified Night’s Watchers, Well done. Well done.,1,9
Night’s Watcher #1," You earned that, Snow.",1,9
Night’s Watcher #2, Well done.,1,9
Pyp," Go on, let's have a look.",1,9
Jon Snow, At what?,1,9
Grenn, The sword! Show us the sword.,1,9
All, Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword!,1,9
Pyp, Let's have a look.,1,9
Grenn, Piss off.,1,9
Pyp," Come on, l want to have a look at it in the light. Give it here!",1,9
Grenn, Look at its eyes.,1,9
Jon Snow, What is it?,1,9
Samwell Tarly, l - l can't.,1,9
Jon Snow, You can't what?,1,9
Samwell Tarly, l'm really not supposed to say.,1,9
Jon Snow, And yet you really want to say. You want to say that…,1,9
Samwell Tarly, There was a raven. l read the message to Maester Aemon. lt's your brother Robb.,1,9
Jon Snow, What? What about him?,1,9
Samwell Tarly," He's heading south. To war. All his bannermen have rallied to his side, they'll keep him safe.",1,9
Jon Snow, l should be there. l should be with him.,1,9
Greatjon Umber," lf we do that, they'll never get back across.",1,9
Robb Stark, Well? What did he say?,1,9
Catelyn Stark," Lord Walder has granted your crossing. His men are yours, as well.",1,9
Robb Stark, Huh.,1,9
Catelyn Stark, Less the 400 he will keep here to hold the crossing against any who would pursue you.,1,9
Robb Stark, What does he want in return?,1,9
Catelyn Stark, You will be taking on his son Olyvar as your personal squire. He expects a knighthood in good time.,1,9
Robb Stark," Fine, fine. And?",1,9
Catelyn Stark, And Arya will marry his son Waldron when they both come of age.,1,9
Robb Stark, She won't be happy about that. And?,1,9
Catelyn Stark, And when the fighting is done you will marry one of his daughters. Whichever you prefer. He has a number he thinks will be suitable.,1,9
Robb Stark, l see. Did you get a look at his daughters?,1,9
Catelyn Stark, l did.,1,9
Robb Stark, And?,1,9
Catelyn Stark, One was – Do you consent?,1,9
Robb Stark, Can l refuse?,1,9
Catelyn Stark, Not if you want to cross.,1,9
Robb Stark, Then l consent.,1,9
Jon Snow, Sam said you wanted to see me?,1,9
Maester Aemon," l did indeed. Perhaps you would be kind enough to assist me. Tell me, did you ever wonder why the men of the Night's Watch take no wives and father no children?",1,9
Jon Snow, No.,1,9
Maester Aemon," So they will not love. Love is the death of duty. lf the day should ever come when your lord father was forced to choose between honor on the one hand and those he loves on the other, what would he do?",1,9
Jon Snow," He would do whatever was right, no matter what.",1,9
Maester Aemon," Then Lord Stark is one man in 10,000. Most of us are not so strong. What is honor compared to a woman's love? And what is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms? Or a brother's smile?",1,9
Jon Snow, Sam told you.,1,9
Maester Aemon," We're all human. Oh, we all do our duty when there's no cost to it. Honor comes easy then. Yet sooner or later in every man's life there comes a day when it is not easy. A day when he must choose.",1,9
Jon Snow, And this is my day? ls that what you're saying?,1,9
Maester Aemon," Oh, it hurts, boy. Oh, yes. l know.",1,9
Jon Snow," You do not know. No one knows. l may be a bastard, but he is my father and Robb is my brother.",1,9
Maester Aemon," The gods were cruel when they saw fit to test my vows. They waited till l was old. What could l do when the ravens brought the news from the South: the ruin of my House, the death of my family? l was helpless, blind, frail. But when l heard they had killed my brother's son and his poor son and the children! Even the little children.",1,9
Maester Aemon," The gods were cruel when they saw fit to test my vows. They waited till l was old. What could l do when the ravens brought the news from the South: the ruin of my House, the death of my family? l was helpless, blind, frail. But when l heard they had killed my brother's son and his poor son and the children! Even the little children.",1,9
Jon Snow, Who are you?,1,9
Maester Aemon," My father was Maekar, the first of his name. My brother Aegon reigned after him when l had refused the throne. And he was followed by his son Aerys whom they called the Mad King.",1,9
Jon Snow, You're Aemon Targaryen.,1,9
Maester Aemon," l'm a maester of the Citadel, bound in service to Castle Black and the Night's Watch. l will not tell you to stay or go. You must make that choice yourself and live with it for the rest of your days. As l have.",1,9
Daenerys Targaryen, (in Dothraki) My lord… My sun and stars… Drogo.,1,9
Khal Drogo, (in Dothraki) My horse…,1,9
Cohollo, (in Dothraki) Blood of my blood…,1,9
Khal Drogo," (in Dothraki) No, l must ride.",1,9
Qotho, (in Dothraki) He fell from his horse. A Khal who cannot ride is no Khal.,1,9
Daenerys Targaryen," (in Dothraki) He's tired, that's all. He needs to rest. We've ridden far enough today. We'll camp here.",1,9
Qotho, (in Dothraki) This is no place to camp. A woman does not give us orders. Not even a Khaleesi.,1,9
Daenerys Targaryen, (in Dothraki) We'll camp here. Tell them Khal Drogo commanded it.,1,9
Qotho," (in Dothraki) You do not command me, Khaleesi.",1,9
Daenerys Targaryen, (in Dothraki) Find Mirri Maz Duur. Bring her to me.,1,9
Qotho," (in Dothraki) The witch? l'll bring you her head, Khaleesi.",1,9
Daenerys Targaryen, (in Dothraki) Bring her to me unharmed or Khal Drogo will hear why you denied me.,1,9
Qotho, (in Dothraki) Hyah! Hyah!,1,9
Kevan Lannister, Our scouts tell us the Stark host has moved south from the Twins with Lord Frey's levies in tow. They're a day's march north.,1,9
Tywin Lannister," The boy may lack experience and sense, but he does have a certain mindless provincial courage.",1,9
Tyrion Lannister," Oh, do continue. Didn't mean to interrupt.",1,9
Tywin Lannister," l do hope your savages are going to be of some use, otherwise we've wasted good steel on them.",1,9
Kevan Lannister," The great hairy one insisted he must have two battleaxes. Heavy black steel, double-sided.",1,9
Tyrion Lannister, Shagga likes axes.,1,9
Tywin Lannister," When the battle commences, you and your wildlings will be in the vanguard.",1,9
Tyrion Lannister, The vanguard? Me and the tribesmen on the front lines?,1,9
Kevan Lannister, They do seem rather ferocious.,1,9
Tyrion Lannister," Ferocious? Last night a Moon Brother stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage. Three Stone Crows seized the Moon Brother and opened his throat. Bronn managed to keep Shagga from chopping off the dead man's cock, which was fortunate, but even still, Ulf is demanding blood money, which Shagga and Gunthor refuse to pay.",1,9
Tywin Lannister," When soldiers lack discipline, the fault lies with their commander.",1,9
Tyrion Lannister, Surely there are ways to have me killed that would be less detrimental to the war effort.,1,9
Tywin Lannister, There'll be no more discussion on the matter.,1,9
Tyrion Lannister," lt appears l'm not hungry after all. Excuse me, my lords.",1,9
Tyrion Lannister, Where did you find one so pretty at this hour?,1,9
Bronn, l took her.,1,9
Tyrion Lannister, Took her? From whom?,1,9
Bronn," From, uh, Ser What's-his-name? l don't know. Ginger cunt, three tents down.",1,9
Tyrion Lannister, And he didn't have anything to say about it?,1,9
Bronn, He said something.,1,9
Tyrion Lannister," Well, the odds of me living long enough for him to retaliate have just dropped drastically. We'll be at the vanguard tomorrow.",1,9
Bronn," Oh, well. l, uh, think l'll go and find myself one.",1,9
Tyrion Lannister, Who are you?,1,9
Prostitute, Who would you like me to be?,1,9
Tyrion Lannister, What did your mother call you?,1,9
Prostitute, Shae. What did your mother call you?,1,9
Tyrion Lannister, My mother died giving birth to me.,1,9
Shae, ls that why l'm here? So we can talk about our mothers?,1,9
Tyrion Lannister, What sort of accent is that?,1,9
Shae, Foreign.,1,9
Tyrion Lannister, For-,1,9
Shae, What do you want from me?,1,9
Tyrion Lannister," What do l want from you? l want you to share my tent. l want you to pour my wine, laugh at my jokes, rub my legs when they're sore after a day's ride. l want you to take no other man to bed for as long as we're together. And l want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world. Which it may well be.",1,9
Shae, And what do l get?,1,9
Tyrion Lannister," One - safety. No one will hurt you for as long as you're mine. Two - the pleasure of my company, which l have heard is spectacular.",1,9
Shae, Who told you this? Women you paid?,1,9
Tyrion Lannister, And three - more gold than you can spend if you lived a thousand years. Do you accept my proposal?,1,9
Shae, Let's start with your last night in this world.,1,9
Jorah Mormont, Khaleesi.,1,9
Daenerys Targaryen, Come. He's very strong. No one understands how strong he is.,1,9
Jorah Mormont," He will die tonight, Khaleesi.",1,9
Daenerys Targaryen, He can't. He can't. l won't let him.,1,9
Jorah Mormont, Even a queen doesn't have that power. We must go quickly. l've heard there's a good port in Asshai.,1,9
Daenerys Targaryen, l won't leave him.,1,9
Jorah Mormont," He's already gone, Khaleesi.",1,9
Daenerys Targaryen," Even if he dies, why would l run? l am khaleesi, and my my son will be khal after Drogo.",1,9
Jorah Mormont," This isn't Westeros, where men honor blood. Here they only honor strength. There will be fighting after Drogo dies. Whoever wins that fight will be the new khal. He won't want any rivals. Your boy will be plucked from your breast and given to the dogs.",1,9
Daenerys Targaryen, l won't leave him.,1,9
Mirri Maz Duur, The wound has festered.,1,9
Qotho," (in Dothraki) You did this, witch. (pulls a dagger out of its sheath)",1,9
Daenerys Targaryen, (in Dothraki) Stop it! l don't want her hurt.,1,9
Qotho," (in Dothraki) No? No? You don't want her hurt? Pray we don't hurt you, too. You let this witch put her hands on our Khal.",1,9
Jorah Mormont, (in Dothraki) Rein in your tongue. She is still your Khaleesi.,1,9
Qotho," (in Dothraki) Only while the blood of my blood lives. When he dies, she is nothing.",1,9
Daenerys Targaryen, (in Dothraki) l have never been nothing. l am the blood of the dragon.,1,9
Qotho," (in Dothraki) The dragons are all dead, Khaleesi.",1,9
Daenerys Targaryen," l think you should wear your armor tonight, ser.",1,9
Jorah Mormont, l think you're right.,1,9
Mirri Maz Duur, You've saved me once more.,1,9
Daenerys Targaryen, And now you must save him.,1,9
Mirri Maz Duur, He's beyond the healer's skills. All l can do is ease his path.,1,9
Daenerys Targaryen, Save him and l will free you. l swear it. You must know a way. Some – some magic.,1,9
Mirri Maz Duur, There is a spell. Some would say death is cleaner.,1,9
Daenerys Targaryen, Do it. Save him.,1,9
Mirri Maz Duur, There is a price.,1,9
Daenerys Targaryen," You'll have gold, whatever you want.",1,9
Mirri Maz Duur, lt's not a matter of gold. This is blood magic. Only death pays for life.,1,9
Daenerys Targaryen, My death?,1,9
Mirri Maz Duur," No, not your death, Khaleesi. Bring me his horse.",1,9
Rakharo," Khaleesi, do not do this thing. Let me kill this witch.",1,9
Daenerys Targaryen, Kill her and you kill your khal.,1,9
Rakharo, This is blood magic. lt is forbidden.,1,9
Daenerys Targaryen, l am your khaleesi. l tell you what is forbidden.,1,9
Mirri Maz Duur, Go. Now.,1,9
Daenerys Targaryen, Take her and leave. Take her!,1,9
Mirri Maz Duur," You must go also, lady. Once l begin to sing, no one must enter the tent. The dead will dance here tonight.",1,9
Daenerys Targaryen, No one will enter.,1,9
Daenerys Targaryen, Bring him back to me.,1,9
Daenerys Targaryen, l have to save him.,1,9
Qotho, (in Dothraki) This must not be.,1,9
Daenerys Targaryen, (in Dothraki) This must be.,1,9
Qotho, (in Dothraki) Witch.,1,9
Rakharo, (in Dothraki) Nothing good will come of this.,1,9
Daenerys Targaryen," (in Dothraki) No, you can't.",1,9
Irri, Khaleesi!,1,9
Jorah Mormont," (in Dothraki) No further, horselord.",1,9
Jorah Mormont, Are you hurt?,1,9
Daenerys Targaryen, The baby –,1,9
Jorah Mormont, Hmm?,1,9
Daenerys Targaryen, … is coming.,1,9
Jorah Mormont, Fetch the midwives.,1,9
Rakharo, They will not come. They say she is cursed.,1,9
Jorah Mormont, They'll come or l'll have their heads.,1,9
Rakharo, The witch - she can bring baby. l hear her say so.,1,9
Shae," Are you in agony, my lion?",1,9
Tyrion Lannister, No.,1,9
Shae, You look like you're in agony. The fire is burning your pretty soft skin.,1,9
Tyrion Lannister," Ah! Damn you, woman. Are you immune to pain?",1,9
Shae, Just used to it.,1,9
Bronn, Drink.,1,9
Tyrion Lannister, Let's play a new game.,1,9
Bronn, There's a Braavosi knife game l could teach you.,1,9
Tyrion Lannister, Does it involve the potential for losing fingers?,1,9
Bronn, Not if you win.,1,9
Tyrion Lannister," No! No fire games, no knife games. Let's do something l'm good at.",1,9
Shae, What are you good at?,1,9
Tyrion Lannister, l happen to be a great judge of character.,1,9
Bronn, This sounds like a boring game.,1,9
Tyrion Lannister," lt's not. Here's how it works - l make a statement about your past. lf l'm right, you drink. lf l'm wrong, l drink. And no lying. l'll know if you're lying.",1,9
Shae, l don't want to play this game.,1,9
Tyrion Lannister, Fine. Bronn first. Your father beat you.,1,9
Bronn, But my mother hit harder.,1,9
Tyrion Lannister, You killed your first man before you were 12.,1,9
Bronn," lt was a woman. (Tyrion drinks. Shae looks at Bronn, surprised.) She swung an axe at me.",1,9
Tyrion Lannister, You've been north of the Wall.,1,9
Shae, What brought you up there?,1,9
Bronn, Work.,1,9
Tyrion Lannister," And you once loved a woman many years ago, but it turned out badly so you've never let yourself love again. Oh, wait, that's me. (Tyrion drinks) Your turn, my mysterious foreign beauty.",1,9
Shae, l don't want to play.,1,9
Tyrion Lannister, lt's fun! Look at the fun we're having. Your mother was a whore.,1,9
Shae, Drink.,1,9
Tyrion Lannister," All right. Your father left the family when you were very young, never to return.",1,9
Shae, Drink.,1,9
Tyrion Lannister, And we've established the rules about lying?,1,9
Shae, Drink!,1,9
Tyrion Lannister, You wanted a different life. You came from somewhere and you wanted to be elsewhere.,1,9
Bronn, The whole shit-stained world could drink off that one.,1,9
Tyrion Lannister," So, specifics… You wanted to be elsewhere, but how would you get there? l don't believe the life of the Silent Sisters is for you. So, what's a lowborn girl to do?",1,9
Shae, Drink.,1,9
Tyrion Lannister, Are you sure –,1,9
Shae," Drink! And don't talk about my mother and father ever, or l will carve your eyes from your head.",1,9
Tyrion Lannister," My dear lady, if l have offended you, l apologize.",1,9
Shae, My turn.,1,9
Tyrion Lannister," Fine, fine. Ask away. Try to penetrate the enigma that is me.",1,9
Shae, Who were you in love with?,1,9
Tyrion Lannister, That's not how the game works.,1,9
Shae, l don't care the way the game works.,1,9
Bronn, Our lord here used to be married.,1,9
Shae, Married?,1,9
Tyrion Lannister, How did you hear that?,1,9
Bronn, You hear lots of things playing dice with Lannister soldiers.,1,9
Tyrion Lannister," Another night, perhaps.",1,9
Shae, Not another night. This night.,1,9
Tyrion Lannister, lt's not a pleasant story.,1,9
Shae," Oh, maybe l will cry.",1,9
Bronn, l'm guessing the lady and l can tell more unpleasant stories than your lordship.,1,9
Tyrion Lannister," So l was 16. My brother Jaime and l were riding, when we heard a scream. She ran out onto the road, clothes half torn off, with two men on her heels. Jaime scared away the men easily enough, while l wrapped her in my cloak. She was too scared to send off on her own, so while Jaime hunted down the rapers l took her to the nearest inn and fed her. Her name was Tysha. She was a wheelwright's orphan. And she was hungry. Together we finished off three chickens and a flagon of wine. lmpossible as it seems, there was a time when l was unaccustomed to wine. l forgot how afraid l was around girls. how l was always waiting for them to laugh at me or look away embarrassed, or ask me about my tall, handsome brother. l forgot about everything but Tysha. And somehow l found myself in her bed.",1,9
Bronn," For three chickens, l should hope so.",1,9
Tyrion Lannister," lt didn't last long. l didn't know what the hell l was doing. But she was good to me. She kissed me afterwards and sang me a song. And by morning l was deep enough in love to ask for her hand. A few lies, a few gold coins, one drunken septon and there you have it - man and wife. For a fortnight anyway, until the septon sobered up and told my father.",1,9
Bronn," Well, l imagine that was the end of all that.",1,9
Tyrion Lannister," Not quite. First, my father had Jaime tell me the truth. The girl was a whore, you see. Jaime had arranged the whole thing - the road, the rapers, all of it. He thought it was time l had a woman. After my brother confessed, my father brought in my wife and gave her to his guards. He paid her well - a silver for each man. How many whores command that kind of price? He brought me into the barracks and made me watch. By the end, she had so much silver that the coins were slipping through her fingers and rolling on to the floor.",1,9
Bronn, l would have killed the man who did that to me.,1,9
Shae, You should have known she was a whore.,1,9
Tyrion Lannister," Really? l was 16, drunk and in love.",1,9
Shae, A girl who was almost raped doesn't invite another man into her bed two hours later.,1,9
Tyrion Lannister," As l said, l was young and stupid.",1,9
Shae, You are still young and stupid.,1,9
Tyrion Lannister, What is it? What do you want?,1,9
Bronn, You're sleeping through the war.,1,9
Tyrion Lannister, What?,1,9
Bronn, They stole a night's march on us. They're a mile north.,1,9
Tyrion Lannister, Get my squire!,1,9
Bronn, You don't have a squire.,1,9
Tyrion Lannister," lf l die, weep for me.",1,9
Shae, You'll be dead. How will you know?,1,9
Tyrion Lannister, l'll know.,1,9
Lannister soldier , Watch out! Move!,1,9
Lannister soldier , Out of the way! Move aside!,1,9
Bronn, Stay low.,1,9
Tyrion Lannister, Stay low?,1,9
Bronn," lf you're lucky, no one will notice you.",1,9
Tyrion Lannister," l was born lucky. Tribesmen of the Vale, gather round! Stone Crows! Black Ears! Burned Men! Moon Brothers! And Painted Dogs! Your dominion over the Vale begins now! Onward, to claim what is yours!",1,9
Tribesmen of the Vale (chanting), Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man!,1,9
Tyrion Lannister, To battle!,1,9
Bronn, You're a shit warrior.,1,9
Tyrion Lannister, l'm alive?,1,9
Bronn, You're alive.,1,9
Tyrion Lannister, Did we win?,1,9
Bronn, We wouldn't be having this conversation if we didn't.,1,9
Tyrion Lannister, How did our tribesmen do?,1,9
Bronn," Yeah, good.",1,9
Tyrion Lannister, lt's nice to see them getting along.,1,9
Tywin Lannister, You're wounded.,1,9
Tyrion Lannister, Good of you to notice. l hear we won.,1,9
Tywin Lannister," Huh! The scouts were wrong. There were 2,000 Stark bannermen, not 20 [thousand].",1,9
Tyrion Lannister," Did we get the Stark boy, at least?",1,9
Tywin Lannister, He wasn't here.,1,9
Tyrion Lannister, Where was he?,1,9
Tywin Lannister," With his other 18,000 men.",1,9
Tyrion Lannister, And where are they?,1,9
Rodrik Cassel," We should go, my lady.",1,9
Catelyn Stark, No!,1,9

Catelyn Stark, lt is not your sword l want. Give me my daughters back. Give me my husband.,1,9
Jaime Lannister," l've lost them too, l'm afraid.",1,9
Theon Greyjoy," Kill him, Robb. Send his head to his father. He cut down ten of our men. You saw him.",1,9
Robb Stark, He's more use to us alive than dead.,1,9
Catelyn Stark, Take him away and put him in irons.,1,9
Jaime Lannister," We could end this war right now, boy, save thousands of lives. You fight for the Starks, l fight for the Lannisters. Swords or lances, teeth, nails - choose your weapons and let's end this here and now.",1,9
Robb Stark," lf we do it your way, Kingslayer, you'd win. We're not doing it your way.",1,9
Greatjon Umber," Come on, pretty man.",1,9
Robb Stark," l sent 2,000 men to their graves today.",1,9
Theon Greyjoy, The bards will sing songs of their sacrifice.,1,9
Robb Stark, Aye. But the dead won't hear them. (making a speech to his bannermen) One victory does not make us conquerors. Did we free my father? Did we rescue my sisters from the queen? Did we free the North from those who want us on our knees? This war is far from over.,1,9
Arya Stark, Could l have one? A lemon one or any of them.,1,9
King’s Landing Baker, Three coppers.,1,9

Eddark Stark," I am Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Hand of the King. I come before you to confess my treason in the sight of Gods and men. I betrayed the faith of my King and the trust of my friend Robert. I swore to protect and defend his children, but before his blood was cold I plotted to murder his son and seize the Throne for myself.

Joffrey Baratheon," My mother wishes me to let Lord Eddard join The Night's Watch. Stripped of all titles and powers, he would serve the realm in permanent exile. And My Lady Sansa has begged mercy for her father. But they have the soft hearts of women. So long as I am your King, treason shall never go unpunished. Ser Ilyn, bring me his head!",1,9

Sansa Stark," Stop him, stop!",1,9
Yoren," Look at me. Look at me! Do you remember me now, boy, eh? Remember me? There's a bright boy. You'll be coming with me, boy, and you'll be keeping your mouth shut.",1,10
Yoren," Keep your mouth shut, boy. (takes out a knife)",1,10
Arya Stark, l'm not a boy!,1,10
Yoren," You're not a smart boy, is that what you're trying to say? Do you want to live, boy?! (starts cutting Arya’s hair as the screams and shouts from the crowd are heard above) North, boy, we're going north.",1,10

Bran Stark, You're afraid. Just like Hodor.,1,10
Osha, l'm not afraid of some hole in the ground.,1,10
Bran Stark, You've lived beyond the Wall. What are you scared of? l'm a crippled boy and l'm willing to go.,1,10
Bran Stark," That's my grandfather, Lord Rickard. He was burned alive by the Mad King, Aerys. That's Lyanna, my father's sister. King Robert was supposed to marry her, but Rhaegar Targaryen kidnapped her. Robert started a war to win her back. He killed Rhaegar, but she died anyway. That's where l saw Father.",1,10
Osha, You see? He's not here.,1,10
Rickon Stark," Here, Shaggydog.",1,10
Bran Stark, Rickon!,1,10
Osha, That beast is supposed to be chained in the kennels!,1,10
Rickon Stark, He doesn't like chains.,1,10
Bran Stark, What are you doing down here? Come back up with us.,1,10
Rickon Stark," No, l came to see Father.",1,10
Bran Stark, How many times have l told you? He's in King's Landing with Sansa and Arya.,1,10

Marillion, (singing),1,10
Joffrey Baratheon, Very amusing. lsn't it a funny song? Thank you for your rendition. l imagine it was even better received at that tavern.,1,10
Marillion," l'm so sorry, Your Grace. l'll never sing it again, l swear.",1,10
Joffrey Baratheon," Tell me, which do you favor - your fingers or your tongue?",1,10
Marillion, Your Grace?,1,10
Joffrey Baratheon," Fingers or your tongue? lf you got to keep one, which would it be? Or l could just cut your throat.",1,10
Marillion," Every man needs hands, Your Grace.",1,10
Joffrey Baratheon, Good. Tongue it is.,1,10
Marillion," Your Grace, please. l won't sing, Your Grace.",1,10
Joffrey Baratheon," Ser llyn, who better than you to carry out the sentence?",1,10

Joffrey Baratheon, You look quite nice.,1,10
Sansa Stark," Thank you, my lord.",1,10
Joffrey Baratheon, Your Grace. l'm King now.,1,10

Joffrey Baratheon," And as soon as you've had your blood, l'll put a son in you. Mother says that shouldn't be long.",1,10
Sansa Stark," No! Please, no!",1,10
Joffrey Baratheon, (pointing at one of the heads) This one's your father. This one here. Look at it and see what happens to traitors.,1,10
Sansa Stark, You promised to be merciful.,1,10
Joffrey Baratheon, l was. l gave him a clean death. Look at him.,1,10
Sansa Stark," Please let me go home. l won't do any treason, l swear –",1,10
Joffrey Baratheon," Mother says l'm still to marry you. So you'll stay here, and obey. Look at him!",1,10
Joffrey Baratheon, Well?,1,10
Sansa Stark, How long do l have to look?,1,10
Joffrey Baratheon, As long as it pleases me. Do you want to see the rest?,1,10
Sansa Stark, lf it please Your Grace.,1,10
Joffrey Baratheon," That's your Septa there. (shot of the impaled head of a woman with the traditional Septa headscarf) l'll tell you what, l'm going to give you a present. After l raise my armies and kill your traitor brother, l'm going to give you his head as well.",1,10
Sansa Stark," Or maybe he'll give me yours. (looks defiantly at Joffrey, who cowers)",1,10
Joffrey Baratheon," My mother tells me a king should never strike his lady. Ser Meryn.Ser Meryn strikes Sansa repeatedly with the back of his (armoured) hand, leaving her lip bloodied. Sansa notices the stone bridge Joffrey is on leads to a street some feet below. She moves forward to lunge him from the edge, but she’s stopped by the Hound.",1,10
Sandor Clegane," Here, girl. (cleans her bloody lip with a rag)",1,10
Joffrey Baratheon, Will you obey now? Or do you need another lesson? l'll look for you in court.,1,10
Sandor Clegane," Save yourself some pain, girl. Give him what he wants.",1,10
Sandor Clegane, You'll be needing that again.,1,10
Jonos Bracken, The proper course is clear - pledge fealty to King Renly and move south to join our forces with his.,1,10
Robb Stark, Renly is not the king.,1,10
Jonos Bracken," You cannot mean to hold to Joffrey, my lord. He put your father to death.",1,10
Robb Stark," That doesn't make Renly king. He's Robert's youngest brother. lf Bran can't be Lord of Winterfell before me, Renly can't be king before Stannis.",1,10
Jonos Bracken, Do you mean to declare us for Stannis?,1,10
Galbart Glover, Renly is not right! lf we put ourselves behind Stannis…,1,10
Greatjon Umber," My Lords. My Lords! Here is what l say to these two kings. Renly Baratheon is nothing to me, nor Stannis neither. Why should they rule over me and mine from some flowery seat in the South? What do they know of the Wall or the Wolfswood? Even their gods are wrong! Why shouldn't we rule ourselves again? lt was the dragons we bowed to and now the dragons are dead! There sits the only king l mean to bend my knee to - the King in the North! (The Greatjon bows to Robb with his sword unsheathed; Robb rises)",1,10
Rickard Karstark, l'll have peace on those terms. They can keep their Red Castle and their iron chair too. (bows to Robb and extends him his sword) The King in the North!,1,10
Theon Greyjoy," Am l your brother, now and always?",1,10
Robb Stark, Now and always.,1,10
Theon Greyjoy," (takes out his sword, bows to Robb) My sword is yours in victory and defeat, from this day until my last day.",1,10
Greatjon Umber, The King in the North!,1,10

Stark Guard, Lady Stark.,1,10
Catelyn Stark, l want to see him. Now! Leave us.,1,10
Catelyn Stark, Leave us. (the guards leave),1,10
Jaime Lannister," You look lovely tonight, Lady Stark. Widowhood becomes you. (Catelyn grabs a large rock from the ground) Your bed must be lonely. ls that why you came? l'm not at my best, but l think l could be of service. You slip out of that gown and we'll see if l'm up to it. (She marches towards him and hits the rock against his forehead) Oh, l do like a violent woman.",1,10
Catelyn Stark," l will kill you tonight, Ser. Pack your head in a box and send it to your sister.",1,10
Jaime Lannister," Let me show you how. Hit me again, over the ear. And again and again. You're stronger than you look, it shouldn't take long.",1,10
Catelyn Stark," That is what you want the world to believe, isn't it? That you don't fear death.",1,10
Jaime Lannister," But l don't, my lady. The dark is coming for all of us. Why cry about it?",1,10
Catelyn Stark," Because you are going to the deepest of the seven hells, if the gods are just.",1,10
Jaime Lannister, What gods are those? The trees your husband prayed to? Where were the trees when his head was getting chopped off? lf your gods are real and if they are just why is the world so full of injustice?,1,10
Catelyn Stark, Because of men like you.,1,10
Jaime Lannister, There are no men like me. Only me.,1,10
Catelyn Stark, My son Bran. How did he come to fall from that tower?,1,10
Jaime Lannister, l pushed him out the window.,1,10
Catelyn Stark, Why?,1,10
Jaime Lannister, I hoped the fall would kill him.,1,10
Catelyn Stark, Why?,1,10
Jaime Lannister, You should get some sleep. lt's going to be a long war. (Catelyn drops the rock and goes away),1,10
Lancel Lannister," l can't believe we're actually at war. Was it this exciting last time, when you were young? What does it say? Have we captured Robb Stark yet? What's our next move?",1,10
Cersei Lannister, Stop talking. Get back into bed.,1,10
Tywin Lannister, They have my son.,1,10
Tyrion Lannister, The Stark boy appears to be less green than we'd hoped.,1,10
Leo Lefford, l've heard his wolf killed a dozen men and as many horses.,1,10
Addam Marbrand, ls it true about Stannis and Renly?,1,10
Kevan Lannister," Both Baratheon brothers have taken up against us. Jaime captured, his armies scattered. lt's a catastrophe. Perhaps we should sue for peace.",1,10
Tyrion Lannister, There's your peace. Joffrey saw to that when he decided to remove Ned Stark's head. You'll have an easier time drinking from that cup than you will bringing Robb Stark to the table now. He's winning – in case you hadn't noticed.,1,10
Kevan Lannister, l'm told we still have his sisters.,1,10
Leo Lefford, The first order of business is ransoming Ser Jaime.,1,10
Addam Marbrand, Kevan Lannister: First we must return to Casterly Rock to raise –,1,10
Addam Marbrand, Kevan Lannister: First we must return to Casterly Rock to raise –,1,10
Tywin Lannister," (shouting) They have my son! Get out, all of you. (to Tyrion) Not you. You were right about Eddard Stark. lf he were alive, we could have used him to broker a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun, which would have given us more time to deal with Robert's brothers. But now – madness. Madness and stupidity. l always thought you were a stunted fool. Perhaps l was wrong.",1,10
Tyrion Lannister," Half wrong. l'm new to strategy, but unless we want to be surrounded by three armies, it appears we can't stay here.",1,10
Tywin Lannister, No one will stay here. Ser Gregor will head out with 500 riders and set the Riverland on fire from God's Eye to the Red Fork. The rest of us will regroup at Harrenhal. And you will go to King's Landing.,1,10
Tyrion Lannister, And do what?,1,10
Tywin Lannister," Rule. You will serve as Hand of the King in my stead. You will bring that boy king to heel, and his mother too, if needs be. And if you get so much as a whiff of treason from any of the rest – Baelish, Varys, Pycelle…",1,10
Tyrion Lannister," Heads, spikes, walls. Why not my uncle? Why not anyone? Why me?",1,10
Tywin Lannister," You're my son. Oh, one more thing. You will not take that whore to court. Do you understand?",1,10
Daenerys Targaryen, Ser Jorah?,1,10
Jorah Mormont," Gently, gently.",1,10
Daenerys Targaryen, My son – where is he? l want him. Where is he?,1,10
Jorah Mormont, The boy did not live.,1,10
Daenerys Targaryen, Tell me.,1,10
Jorah Mormont, What is there to tell?,1,10
Daenerys Targaryen, How did my son die?,1,10
Jorah Mormont," He never lived, my princess. The women say –",1,10
Daenerys Targaryen, What do the women say?,1,10
Jorah Mormont, They say the child was –,1,10
Mirri Maz Duur," (entering the tent) Monstrous, twisted. l pulled him out myself. He was scaled like a lizard, blind, with leather wings like the wings of a bat. When l touched him the skin fell from his bones. Inside he was full of graveworms. l warned you that only death can pay for life. You knew the price.",1,10
Daenerys Targaryen, Where is Khal Drogo? Show him to me. Show me what l bought with my son's life.,1,10
Mirri Maz Duur," As you command, lady. Come. l will take you to him.",1,10
Jorah Mormont, Time enough for that later –,1,10
Daenerys Targaryen, l want to see him now.,1,10
Daenerys Targaryen, The khalasar is gone.,1,10
Jorah Mormont," A khal who cannot ride is no khal. The Dothraki follow only the strong. l'm sorry, my Princess.",1,10
Daenerys Targaryen," Drogo! (in Dothraki) My sun and stars. (in the Common Tongue, to the rest) Why is he out here alone?",1,10
Jorah Mormont," He seems to like the warmth, Princess.",1,10
Mirri Maz Duur," He lives. You asked for life, you paid for life.",1,10
Daenerys Targaryen, (looking at Drogo’s catatonic expression) This is not life. When will he be as he was?,1,10
Mirri Maz Duur," When the sun rises in the west, sets in the east. When the seas go dry. When the mountains blow in the wind like leaves.",1,10
Daenerys Targaryen, Leave us.,1,10
Jorah Mormont, l don't want you alone with this sorceress.,1,10
Daenerys Targaryen, l have nothing more to fear from this woman. Go.,1,10
Daenerys Targaryen, You knew what l was buying and you knew the price.,1,10
Mirri Maz Duur, lt was wrong of them to burn my temple. lt angered the Great Shepherd.,1,10
Daenerys Targaryen, This is not God's work. My child was innocent.,1,10
Mirri Maz Duur, lnnocent? He would have been The Stallion Who Mounts The World. Now he will burn no cities. Now his khalasar will trample no nations into dust.,1,10
Daenerys Targaryen, l spoke for you. l saved you.,1,10
Mirri Maz Duur," Saved me? Three of those riders had already raped me before you saved me, girl. l saw my god's house burn, there where l had healed men and women beyond counting. ln the streets l saw piles of heads, the head of the baker who makes my bread, the head of a young boy that l had cured of fever just three moons past. So tell me again exactly what it was that you saved?",1,10
Daenerys Targaryen, Your life.,1,10
Mirri Maz Duur, Why don't you take a look at your khal. Then you will see exactly what life is worth when all the rest has gone.,1,10
Samwell Tarly, You can't!,1,10
Jon Snow," Get out of my way, Sam.",1,10
Samwell Tarly, They'll put out the word. They'll send out ravens. People will come after you. Do you know what happens to deserters?,1,10
Jon Snow, Better than you do.,1,10
Samwell Tarly, What are you going to do?,1,10
Jon Snow, l'm gonna find my brother and put a sword through King Joffrey's throat. (gets on horseback),1,10
Samwell Tarly, You can't leave us now. We need you here.,1,10
Jon Snow, Move.,1,10
Samwell Tarly, l won't let you go.,1,10
Jon Snow, Move.,1,10
Samwell Tarly, No.,1,10
Jon Snow, Hyah!,1,10
Shae, Hand of the King?,1,10
Tyrion Lannister, So it would seem.,1,10
Shae, And your father said you couldn't take anyone with you to King's Landing?,1,10
Tyrion Lannister," No, he said l couldn't take you with me to King's Landing. He was very specific on that point.",1,10
Shae, He knew my name?,1,10
Tyrion Lannister, What?,1,10
Shae," He said, ""Don't bring Shae with you to King's Landing""?",1,10
Tyrion Lannister," l believe he used the word ""whore"".",1,10
Shae, Are you ashamed of me? Are you afraid that l'm dancing around the court with my tits out?,1,10
Shae," I’m funny now? l'm Shae, the funny whore.",1,10
Tyrion Lannister," My father's probably the most powerful man in the country. Certainly the richest. He has all Seven Kingdoms in his pockets. Everyone everywhere always has to do exactly what my father says. He's always been a cunt. l believe the ladies of the court could learn a great deal from a girl like you. Why don't you come with me, be the Hand's lady? Because the King needs a Hand and the Hand – (Shae kisses Tyrion)",1,10
Shae, l know what a Hand needs.,1,10

Samwell Tarly, Did we get him?,1,10
Grenn," Come on, help me get him up.",1,10
Pyp, Lucky you've got plenty of padding. (to Jon) We're taking you back to where you belong.,1,10
Jon Snow, l belong with my brother.,1,10
Samwell Tarly, But we're your brothers now.,1,10
Grenn, They'll kill you if they find out you've gone.,1,10
Jon Snow, They'll kill you if they know you came after me. Go back.,1,10
Pyp, Sam told us everything. We're sorry about your father.,1,10
Grenn, But it doesn't matter. You took the oath. You can't leave.,1,10
Jon Snow, l have to.,1,10
Grenn, You can't. You said the words.,1,10

Daenerys Targaryen," (in Dothraki) Do you remember our first ride, my sun and stars? lf you are in there, if you haven't gone away, show me. You're a fighter. You've always been a fighter. l need you to fight now. l know you're very far away, but come back to me, my sun and stars.",1,10
Daenerys Targaryen," (crying) When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east. Then you shall return to me, my sun and stars.",1,10
Grand Maester Pycelle," Kings? Oh, l can tell you all there is to know about kings. The thing you need to understand about kings is – For the past 67 years, l've known truly known more kings than any man alive. They're complicated men, but l know how to serve them. Yes, and keep on serving them. Aerys Targaryen. Of all the thousand thousand maladies the Gods visit on us, madness is the worst. He was a good man. Such a charmer. To watch him melt away before my eyes, consumed by dreams of fire and blood. Robert Baratheon was an entirely different animal – powerful man, great warrior, but alas - winning a kingdom and ruling a kingdom are rather different things. They say that if a man goes through life with his battle visor down, he can often be blind to the enemies at his side. Now l serve his son King Joffrey, may the Gods bless his reign.",1,10
Grand Maester Pycelle," He is a capable young man. Strong military mind. Stern. But sternness in defense of the realm is no vice. lt's far too soon to know what manner of king he will be, but l sense true greatness on the horizon for our new King. Mmm. True greatness.",1,10
Ros, So what's the thing?,1,10
Grand Maester Pycelle, What thing?,1,10
Ros," About kings. You said, ""The thing you need to understand about kings"".",1,10
Grand Maester Pycelle, What? Things? What?,1,10
Ros," When you started, you… Never mind.",1,10
Grand Maester Pycelle," Let me see you out, my dear.",1,10
Ros, lt's all right. No need.,1,10
Grand Maester Pycelle," Yes, yes. Till the next time. (Pycelle gets off the bed and stretches his limbs with ease, belying his old age and general sickly demeanor) Right.",1,10
Varys," When you imagine yourself up there, how do you look? Does the crown fit? Do all the lords and ladies simper and bow, the ones who sneered at you for years?",1,10
Petyr Baelish, lt's hard for them to simper and bow without heads.,1,10
Varys, A man with great ambition and no morals… l wouldn't bet against you.,1,10
Petyr Baelish," And what would you do, my friend, if you found yourself sitting up there?",1,10
Varys, l must be one of the few men in this city who doesn't want to be King.,1,10
Petyr Baelish, You must be one of the few men in the city who isn't a man.,1,10
Varys," Oh, you can do better than that.",1,10
Petyr Baelish," When they castrated you, did they take the pillar with the stones? l've always wondered.",1,10

Varys," l am flattered, of course, to be pictured at all.",1,10
Petyr Baelish," Must be strange for you, even after all these years… a man from another land, despised by most, feared by all.",1,10
Varys, Am l? That is good to know. Do you lie awake at night fearing my gash?,1,10
Petyr Baelish, But you carry on whispering in one king's ear and then the next. l admire you.,1,10
Varys," And l admire you, Lord Baelish. A grasper from a minor House with a major talent for befriending powerful men – and women.",1,10
Petyr Baelish," A useful talent, l'm sure you'd agree.",1,10

Varys," (Joffrey arrives, Varys bows) Serving a new King.",1,10
Petyr Baelish, Long may he reign. My king. (bows),1,10
Varys, My king.,1,10
Joffrey Baratheon, My lords. Shall we begin?,1,10
Yoren," You're Arry now, hear me? Arry the orphan boy. No one asks an orphan too many questions, ‘cause nobody gives three shits. What's your name?",1,10
Arya Stark, Arry.,1,10
Yoren," You've a long way to travel, and in bad company. l've 20 this time – men and boys all bound for the Wall. Your lord father gave me the pick of the dungeons, and l didn't find no little lordlings down there. This lot – half of them would turn you over to the King quick as spit for a pardon. And the other half would do the same, except they'd rape you first. So keep to yourself – and when you piss, do it in the woods alone. You stay with this lot, boy. And stay or l'll lock you in the back of the wagon with these three.",1,10
Hot Pie," Watch yourself, midget.",1,10
Lommy Greenhands," He's got a sword, this one.",1,10
Hot Pie, What's a gutter rat like you doing with a sword?,1,10
Lommy Greenhands, Maybe he's a little squire.,1,10
Hot Pie, He ain't no squire. Look at him. He looks like a girl. l bet he stole that sword.,1,10
Lommy Greenhands, Let's have a look. (wrestles Arya to the ground),1,10
Hot Pie, l could use me a sword like that.,1,10
Lommy Greenhands, Take it off him.,1,10
Hot Pie," Give it here, midget.",1,10
Lommy Greenhands, Look at him! You'd better give Hot Pie the sword. l've seen him kick a boy to death.,1,10
Hot Pie, l knocked him down and l kicked him in the balls and l kept kicking him until he was dead. l kicked him all to pieces. You better give me that sword!,1,10
Arya Stark, (pointing Needle at Hot Pie) You want it? l'll give it to you. l already killed one fat boy. l bet you never killed anyone. l bet you're a liar. But l'm not. l'm good at killing fat boys. l like killing fat boys.,1,10
Gendry," Your like picking on the little ones, do you? l've been hammering an anvil these past 10 years. When l hit that steel, it sings. Are you gonna sing when l hit you? (Hot Pie leaves, scared. Gendry talks to Arya alone) This is castle-forged steel. Where'd you steal it?",1,10
Arya Stark, lt was a gift.,1,10
Gendry," lt don't matter now. Where we're going, they don't care what you've done. They've got rapers, pickpockets, highwaymen, murderers.",1,10
Arya Stark, Which are you?,1,10
Gendry," Armourer's apprentice. But my master got sick of me, so here l am.",1,10
Yoren," (shouting) Come on, you sorry sons of whores! lt's a thousand leagues from here to the Wall, and winter is coming!",1,10
Jeor Mormont, Ham. How many days in a row must a man be expected to start his day with ham? Bring me some beer at least. You look exhausted. Was your moonlight ride that tiring?,1,10
Jon Snow, My friends brought me back.,1,10
Jeor Mormont, l didn't say it was your honor.,1,10
Jon Snow, They killed my father.,1,10
Jeor Mormont," And you're gonna bring him back to life, are you? No? Good. We've had enough of that sort of thing. Beyond the Wall, the Rangers are reporting whole villages abandoned. At night they see fires blazing in the mountains from dusk until dawn. A captured wildling swears their tribes are uniting in some secret stronghold, to what ends the gods only know. Outside Eastwatch Cotter Pyke's men discovered four blue-eyed corpses. Unlike us, they were wise enough to burn them. Do you think your brother's war is more important than ours?",1,10
Jon Snow, No.,1,10
Jeor Mormont," When dead men and worse come hunting for us in the night, do you think it matters who sits on the lron Throne?",1,10
Jon Snow, No.,1,10
Jeor Mormont, Good. Because l want you and your wolf with us when we ride out beyond the Wall tomorrow.,1,10
Jon Snow, Beyond the Wall?,1,10
Jeor Mormont," l'll not sit meekly by and wait for the snows. l mean to find out what's happening. The Night's Watch will ride in force against the wildlings, the White Walkers and whatever else is out there. And we will find Benjen Stark, alive or dead. l will command them myself. So l'll only ask you once, Lord Snow, are you a brother of the Night's Watch or a bastard boy who wants to play at war?",1,10
Rakharo," (picking up the dragon eggs from their chest, speaking in Dothraki) ls this your command, Khaleesi? (Daenerys nods, Rakharo places the eggs next to Drogo’s funeral pyre)",1,10
Jorah Mormont, Drogo will have no use for dragon eggs in the Night Lands. Sell them. You can return to the Free Cities and live as a wealthy woman for all your days.,1,10
Daenerys Targaryen, They were not given to me to sell.,1,10
Jorah Mormont," Khaleesi, my Queen, l vow to serve you, obey you, to die for you if need be, but let him go, Khaleesi. l know what you intend. Do not.",1,10
Daenerys Targaryen, l must. You don't understand.,1,10
Jorah Mormont, Don't ask me to stand aside as you climb on that pyre. l won't watch you burn.,1,10
Daenerys Targaryen," ls that what you fear? (kisses Jorah on the cheek, then speaks to the rest of the Dothraki and Lhazareen who stayed with her) You will be my khalasar. l see the faces of slaves. l free you. Take off your collars. Go if you wish, no one will stop you. But if you stay it will be as brothers and sisters, as husbands and wives.",1,10
Daenerys Targaryen," Ser Jorah, bind this woman to the pyre. You swore to obey me.",1,10
Mirri Maz Duur, You will not hear me scream.,1,10
Daenerys Targaryen, I will. But it is not your screams I want. Only your life.,1,10

JOFFREY," (Quietly) Well struck… (Louder) Well struck, Dog.",2,1
JOFFREY, Did you like that?,2,1
SANSA," It was well struck, Your Grace.",2,1
JOFFREY, I already said it was well struck.,2,1
SANSA," Yes, Your Grace.",2,1
JOFFREY, Who's next?,2,1
ANNOUNCER," Lothor Brune, freerider in the service of Lord Baelish.",2,1
ANNOUNCER, Ser Dontos the Red of House Hollard.,2,1
ANNOUNCER, (Yells) Ser Dontos the Red of House Hollard!,2,1
SER DONTOS," Here I am. (Walking down some stairs, awkwardly clutching his helmet and weapon). Here I am. (Drops his helmet). Sorry, Your Grace. (Puts his helmet on backwards). My deepest apologies. (Puts his helmet on correctly).",2,1
JOFFREY, Are you drunk?,2,1
SER DONTOS," No. Uh, no, Your Grace. I had - I had two cups of wine.",2,1
JOFFREY," Two cups? (Dontos nods). That's not much at all. (Joffrey gestures to some wine). Please, have another cup.",2,1
SER DONTOS," Are you sure, Your Grace?",2,1
JOFFREY," Yes, to celebrate my name day. (Smiles) Have two, have as much as you like.",2,1
SER DONTOS," I would be honored, Your Grace.",2,1
JOFFREY," Ser Meryn, help Ser Dontos celebrate my name day. See that he drinks his fill.",2,1
SANSA, You can't!,2,1
JOFFREY, What did you say? Did you say I can't?,2,1
SANSA, I only meant… it would be bad luck to kill a man on your name day.,2,1
JOFFREY, What kind of stupid peasant's superstition...,2,1
THE HOUND," The girl is right. What a man sows on his name day, he reaps all year.",2,1
JOFFREY," (Sighs). Take him away. I'll have him killed tomorrow, the fool.",2,1
SANSA, He is. A fool - you're so clever to see it. He'll make a much better fool than a knight. He doesn't deserve the mercy of a quick death.,2,1
JOFFREY," Did you hear My Lady, Ser Dontos? (Ser Dontos is forced onto his feet). From this day, (Standing up), you'll be my new fool.",2,1
SER DONTOS," Thank you, Your Grace. (Bows). And you, My Lady, thank you.",2,1
TYRION, Beloved nephew.,2,1
TYRION, We looked for you on the battlefield. (Joffrey sits down). You were nowhere to be found.,2,1
JOFFREY," I've been here, ruling the kingdoms.",2,1
TYRION," What a fine job you've done. (Turns to Myrcella). Look at you. (Kisses her). More beautiful than ever. (Turns to Tommen). And you! You, you're going to be bigger than the Hound, but much better looking. (Tyrion smiles. He and Myrcella laugh). This one doesn't like me.",2,1
BRONN, Can't imagine why.,2,1
JOFFREY, We heard you were dead.,2,1
MYRCELLA, I'm glad you're not dead.,2,1
TYRION," Me, too, dear. Death is so boring, especially now with so much excitement in the world. (Looks at Sansa). My Lady, I'm sorry for your loss.",2,1
JOFFREY, Her loss? Her father was a confessed traitor!,2,1
TYRION, But still her father. Surely having so recently lost your own beloved father you can sympathize.,2,1
SANSA," My father was a traitor. My mother and brother are traitors, too. I am loyal to my beloved Joffrey.",2,1
TYRION, Of course you are.,2,1
TYRION," Well, (Gulps down his wine), enjoy your name day, Your Grace. Wish I could stay and celebrate, but there is work to be done.",2,1
JOFFREY, What work? (Bronn and the tribesmen follow Tyrion. Joffrey stands up). Why are you here?,2,1
PYCELLE," The raven arrived from the Citadel this morning, Your Grace. The conclave has met, (The man sets the cage down and removes the cover), considered reports from Maesters all over the Seven Kingdoms, and declared this great summer done, at last. The longest summer in living memory.",2,1
VARYS," The peasants say, a long summer means an even longer winter.",2,1
PYCELLE, A common superstition.,2,1
BAELISH," We have enough wheat for a five-year winter. If it lasts any longer, (Shrugs indifferently), we'll have fewer peasants.",2,1
JANOS," The city's drowning in refugees, Your Grace, fleeing the war. We have nowhere to house them, and with winter coming, it'll only get worse.",2,1
CERSEI," You command the City Watch, do you not, Lord Slynt?",2,1
JANOS," I do, Your Grace.",2,1
CERSEI, And are you not a Lord at my command?,2,1
JANOS," I owe my title and lands to your generosity, Your Grace.",2,1
CERSEI," Then do your job. Shut the gates to the peasants. They belong in the field, not our capital.",2,1
JANOS," Yes, Your Grace.",2,1
TYRION," Don't get up. More ravishing than ever, big sister. (Kisses Cersei on the cheek). War agrees with you. Forgive the interruption, carry on.",2,1
CERSEI, What are you doing here?,2,1
TYRION," (Sits down) It's been a remarkable journey. I, (grabs a glass), pissed off the edge of the Wall, I slept in a sky cell. (Pours himself wine). I fought with the hill tribes. So many adventures, so much to be thankful for.",2,1
CERSEI, What are you doing here? This is the small council.,2,1
TYRION," Yes., well, I, do believe the Hand of the King is welcome at all small council meetings.",2,1
CERSEI, Our father is Hand of the King.,2,1
TYRION," Yes, but in his absence…",2,1
VARYS, Your father has named Lord Tyrion to serve as Hand in his stead while he fights -,2,1
CERSEI, Out! All of you out. (The small council members all get up and leave until it is only Cersei and Tyrion. Cersei stands up and approaches Tyrion). I would like to know how you tricked father into this.,2,1
TYRION," If I were capable of tricking father, I'd be emperor of the world by now. You brought this on yourself. (Cersei sits down).",2,1
CERSEI, I've done nothing.,2,1
TYRION, Quite right. You did nothing when your son called for Ned Stark's head. Now the entire North has risen up against us.,2,1
CERSEI, I tried to stop it.,2,1
TYRION, Did you? You failed. That bit of theater will haunt our family for a generation.,2,1
CERSEI, Robb Stark is a child.,2,1
TYRION, Who's won every battle he's fought. Do you understand we're losing the war?,2,1
CERSEI, What do you know about warfare?,2,1
TYRION, Nothing. But I know people. And I know that our enemies hate each other almost as much as they hate us.,2,1
CERSEI, Joffrey is King.,2,1
TYRION, Joffrey is King.,2,1
CERSEI, You are here to advise him.,2,1
TYRION," I'm only here to advise him. And if the King listens to what I say, the King might just get his Uncle Jaime back.",2,1
CERSEI, How?,2,1
TYRION, You love your children. It's your one redeeming quality. That and your cheekbones. The Starks love their children as well. And we have two of them.,2,1
CERSEI, One.,2,1
TYRION, One?,2,1
CERSEI," Arya, little animal, she disappeared.",2,1
TYRION," Disappeared? What, in a puff of smoke? We had three Starks to trade. You chopped one's head off and let another escape. Father will be furious. It must be odd for you to be the disappointing child.",2,1

LORD," My Lord, may the Old Gods watch over your brother and all our northern sons.",2,1
LORD," The walls of my Holdfast will not stand the winter. The stones were last mortared in the time of King Aerys, and I'm afraid the masons today are not fit to carry their fathers' hammers. When I was a boy, I remember seeing them put up a new tower at Torrhen's Square in a summer. Men worked back then. Today, my Holdfast looks like it was built by drunk children. At night you can hear the wind howling through the gaps. And the Gods forbid it rains. Why, I might as well sleep beneath a waterfall.",2,1
LUWIN, Maintenance of a Holdfast generally falls to the lord of that Holdfast.,2,1
LORD," Generally, yes, but I've sent all the young men off to fight Robb Stark's war.",2,1
BRAN, King Robb. And it's not his war. He didn't choose it.,2,1
LORD," Maybe not, My Lord, but he called in his Banners, and took the men.",2,1
BRAN," Joffrey killed my father, your liege lord. Do you remember your vows, Ser?",2,1
LORD, Of course I remember!,2,1
LUWIN," We can spare four masons for a week, My Lord. Will that be sufficient to repair your walls?",2,1
LORD, I - I believe it will.,2,1
LUWIN," We didn't want him here all day, did we?",2,1
BRAN, I didn't like the way he was talking about Robb.,2,1
LUWIN, Nor did I. But listening to people you'd rather not listen to is one of your responsibilities as Lord of Winterfell. (Bran sighs). Lord Portan.,2,1
PORTAN," (Walks forward). My Lord, may the Old Gods watch over your brother and all our northern sons.",2,1
OSHA, Boil this for an hour and drink the tea. Makes all your pain go away.,2,1

OSHA, Lucky for you.,2,1
BRAN, That way.,2,1
OSHA, You've been having those dreams again.,2,1
BRAN, I don't dream.,2,1
OSHA, Everyone dreams.,2,1
BRAN, I don't. Heard some of the men talking about the comet. (Bran looks up at the comet). They say it's an omen. They say it means Robb will win a great victory in the South.,2,1
OSHA," Did they? (Hodor is kneeling next to the pool in the godswood. Osha begins unstrapping Bran from Hodor’s back). I heard some other fools say it's Lannister Red. Means the Lannisters will rule all Seven Kingdoms before long. I heard a stable boy say it's the color of blood, to mark the death of your father.",2,1
OSHA," The stars don't fall for men. The red comet means one thing, boy. Dragons.",2,1
BRAN, The dragons are all dead. They've been dead for centuries.,2,1

DOREAH," What did your brother say about them, Khaleesi?",2,1
DAENERYS, He said they ate meat.,2,1
DOREAH, He didn't tell you what kind of meat?,2,1
DAENERYS, My brother didn't know anything about dragons. He didn't know anything about anything.,2,1
DAENERYS, She was Drogo's first gift to me.,2,1
JORAH, I remember.,2,1
DAENERYS, I promised to protect them. Promised them their enemies would die screaming. How do I make starvation scream?,2,1
JORAH," A trick I never learned, I'm afraid.",2,1
DAENERYS, Does it ever end?,2,1
JORAH," This is further east than I've ever been. But, yes, Khaleesi, everything ends, even the red waste.",2,1
DAENERYS, And you're sure there's no other way?,2,1
JORAH," If we go south to the land of the Lazarheen, the Lamb Men will kill us and take your dragons. If we go west to the Dothraki Sea, the first Khalasar we meet will kill us and take your dragons.",2,1
DAENERYS, No one will take my dragons.,2,1
JORAH," They are too weak to fight, as are your people. You must be their strength.",2,1
DAENERYS, (Turns to Jorah) As you are mine.,2,1
DAENERYS," (Speaking Dothraki) Rakharo, Aggo, Kovarro. Take our remaining horses. You will ride east, you southeast, and you northeast.",2,1
RAKHARO," (Speaking Dothraki) What do we seek, Khaleesi?",2,1
DAENERYS," (Speaking Dothraki) Cities, living or dead. Caravans and people. Rivers or lakes or the great salt sea. Find how far the Red Waste extends before us, and what lies on the other side.",2,1
DAENERYS," (Speaking Dothraki) Rokharo, you are my last hope, blood of my blood.",2,1

GRENN, It's beyond foul.,2,1
EDD, All the other wildlings for a hundred leagues have disappeared. Craster's still here. He must be doing something right.,2,1
JON, What happens to the boys?,2,1
SAM, Hmm?,2,1
JON, He marries his daughters. What does he do with his sons?,2,1
LORD MORMONT, He said he planned to stop here on his way to the Frostfangs.,2,1
CRASTER," People make all sorts of plans. I haven't seen Benjen Stark in three years. Haven't missed him. Always treated me like scum. (Sips his wine). Haven't had any good wine for a long time. You Southerners make good wine, I'll give you that.",2,1
JON, (Standing off to the side of the room) We're not Southerners.,2,1
CRASTER, Who's this little girl? You're prettier than half my daughters. You got a nice wet twat between your legs? What's your name?,2,1
JON, Jon Snow.,2,1
CRASTER," Snow, eh? Listen to me, bastard. All you lot from south of the Wall, you're Southerners. But now you're in the North, the real North.",2,1
LORD MORMONT, The lad meant no harm.,2,1
CRASTER, I catch that pretty little bastard talking to my daughters -,2,1
LORD MORMONT," No one will talk to your daughters, you have my word. (Turns to Jon) Now, sit down and shut your mouth.",2,1
CRASTER, You bring any of that good wine with you?,2,1
LORD MORMONT, We did. We passed through six villages on the way here. All six were abandoned. Where have all the wildlings gone?,2,1
CRASTER," I could tell you, but I'm thirsty.",2,1
LORD MORMONT, There's a barrel of Dornish wine on the sledge. Bring it in here.,2,1
WATCHMAN," Yes, commander.",2,1
CRASTER, You want to know where they've all gone? North! To join up with Mance Rayder Your old friend.,2,1
LORD MORMONT," He's no friend of mine. He broke his vows, betrayed his brothers!",2,1
CRASTER," Oh, aye. But once he was just a poor black crow. And now he's King-Beyond-the-Wall.",2,1
LORD MORMONT, He's been calling himself that for years. What’s he king of? A frozen lake somewhere?,2,1
CRASTER, That's a good-looking axe. Fresh forged?,2,1
LORD MORMONT, Give it here.,2,1
LORD MORMONT, You'll have another one made at Castle Black. (Hands the axe to Craster). Here.,2,1
CRASTER," (Inspecting the axe). Oh, that's some lovely steel. (Loudly brings the axe down). You want to know what Mance Rayder is doing? Gathering an army. What I hear, he's already got more men than any of your southern kings.",2,1
LORD MORMONT, And where does he plan marching this army?,2,1
CRASTER," When you're all the way north, there's only one direction to go.",2,1
LORD MORMONT, These are bad times to be living alone in the wild. The cold winds are rising.,2,1
CRASTER," Let them come. My roots are sunk deep. (Grabs Gilly) Wife, tell the Lord Crow how content we are.",2,1
GILLY, This is our place. Our husband keeps us safe. Better to live free than die a slave.,2,1
CRASTER," Don't it make you jealous, old man, to see me with all these young wives and you with no one to warm your bed?",2,1
LORD MORMONT, We chose different paths.,2,1
CRASTER," Oh, aye, and you chose the path with no one but boys on it. (Stands up). You'll be wanting to sleep beneath my roof, I suppose, and eat me out of pigs.",2,1
LORD MORMONT, (Stands up) A roof would be welcome. It's been hard riding. We've brought our own food and good steel for you.,2,1
CRASTER," (Addressing the group). Any man lays a hand on one of my wives, he loses the hand. And I see this one, (Gestures towards Jon), staring too long, I might just gouge his eyes out.",2,1

DAVOS, I don't serve the others. I serve Stannis.,2,1

STANNIS, I'll not make peace with Renly while he calls himself King.,2,1
DAVOS," Well, many have already declared for him; Mace Tyrell, Randyll Tarly.",2,1
MELISANDRE, Stannis does not need to beg this lord or that lord for support. The Lord of Light stands behind him.,2,1
DAVOS, And how many ships has the Lord of Light got in his fleet?,2,1
MELISANDRE, He has no need for ships.,2,1
DAVOS," I'm sure he doesn't, but we do if we're going to war. If not Renly, Your Grace, join forces with Robb Stark.",2,1
STANNIS," Who would steal the northern half of my kingdom. I've always served thieves according to their desserts, as you well know, Ser Davos. Joffrey, Renly, Robb Stark, they're all thieves. They'll bend the knee or I'll destroy them.",2,1

DAVOS, (Whispers to Cressen) Don't.,2,1
CRESSEN, A cup of wine to honor the one true God.,2,1
MELISANDRE," The night is dark and full of terrors, old man, but the fire burns them all away. Your Grace.",2,1
CUT TO, NORTH,2,1
JAIME," King in the North. I keep expecting you to leave me in one castle or another for safekeeping, but you drag me along from camp to camp. Have you grown fond of me, Stark? Is that it? I've never seen you with a girl.",2,1
ROBB," If I left you with one of my bannermen, your father would know within a fortnight, and my bannerman would receive a raven with a message, ""Release my son and you'll be rich beyond your dreams. Refuse and your house will be destroyed, root and stem.”",2,1
JAIME, You don't trust the loyalty of the men following you into battle?,2,1
ROBB," Oh, I trust them with my life. Just not with yours.",2,1
JAIME, Smart boy. What's wrong? Don't like being called ‘boy’? Insulted?,2,1
ROBB," You insult yourself, Kingslayer. You've been defeated by a boy.",2,1
ROBB, You're held captive by a boy. Perhaps you'll be killed by a boy. (Grey Wind enters the cage. Jaime looks very nervous). Stannis Baratheon sent ravens to all the high lords of Westeros. King Joffrey Baratheon is neither a true king nor a true Baratheon. (Jaime focuses back on Robb). He's your bastard son.,2,1
JAIME," If that's true, Stannis is the rightful king. How convenient for him.",2,1
ROBB, My father learned the truth. That's why you had him executed.,2,1
JAIME, I was your prisoner when Ned Stark lost his head.,2,1
ROBB, Your son killed him so the world wouldn't learn who fathered him. And you... you pushed my brother from a window because he saw you with the queen.,2,1
JAIME, You have proof? Or do you want to trade gossip like a couple of fishwives?,2,1
ROBB, I'm sending one of your cousins down to King's Landing with my peace terms.,2,1
JAIME, You think my father's going to negotiate with you? You don't know him very well.,2,1
ROBB," No, but he's starting to know me.",2,1
JAIME, Three victories don't make you a conqueror.,2,1
ROBB, It's better than three defeats.,2,1
CUT TO, KING’S LANDING,2,1
SHAE, This city stinks Like dead bodies.,2,1
TYRION," A bit corpsey, yes.",2,1
SHAE, And shit.,2,1
TYRION, I thought you wanted to come here.,2,1
SHAE, I love it.,2,1
TYRION, You love the smell of dead bodies and shit?,2,1
SHAE, And cum and garlic and rum.,2,1
TYRION, You can smell cum from the balcony?,2,1
SHAE, I love the stink. I love the noise. Cities make me want to fuck.,2,1
TYRION, And so did the country.,2,1
SHAE, This is where I belong.,2,1
TYRION," Yes, well, you need to be careful. No one can know you're here.",2,1
SHAE, No one will know.,2,1
TYRION," You can't trust anyone in King's Landing. They're all liars; good liars, bad liars, one or two great liars.",2,1
SHAE, What about you?,2,1
TYRION, Me? I'm not from here. I'm a slave to the truth.,2,1
SHAE, Truth? (Laughs) You are the biggest little liar I have ever met.,2,1
TYRION," Why do you think I am so little? I'm being, (Lays down on the bed with Shae), crushed beneath the weight of all that truth.",2,1
TYRION," Ned Stark actually slept on this, as if the poor man didn't suffer enough. One of the many changes we'll have to make around here.",2,1
CERSEI, Lord Baelish.,2,1
BAELISH, Your Grace.,2,1
CERSEI, I wonder if I might ask you for a favor.,2,1
BAELISH," Of course, Your Grace.",2,1
CERSEI, Ned Stark's youngest daughter Arya... we can't seem to locate her.,2,1
BAELISH," If she's escaped the capital, Winterfell seems the logical destination.",2,1
CERSEI, And yet my friends in the North report no sign of her.,2,1
BAELISH, Curious.,2,1
CERSEI," If we choose to negotiate with the Starks, the girl has some value. Whoever finds her, well, you know what they say about Lannisters and debts.",2,1
BAELISH," Well, you could ask Varys where she is. He'll have an answer for you. Whether you believe it,,, Myself, I have always had a hard time trusting eunuchs. (Smiles) Who knows what they want?",2,1
CERSEI," A mockingbird. (Points to a pin on Baelish’s shirt). You created your own Sigil, didn't you?",2,1
BAELISH, Yes.,2,1
CERSEI, Appropriate for a self-made man with so many songs to sing.,2,1
BAELISH, I'm glad you like it. Some people are fortunate enough to be born into the right family. Others have to find their own way.,2,1
CERSEI," I heard a song once about a boy of modest means who found his way into the home of a very prominent family. He loved the eldest daughter. Sadly, she had eyes for another.",2,1
BAELISH," When boys and girls live in the same home, awkward situations can arise. Sometimes, I've heard, even brothers and sisters develop certain affections. And when these affections become common knowledge, well, that is an awkward situation, indeed. Especially in a prominent family. But prominent families often forget a simple truth, I've found.",2,1
CERSEI, And which truth is that?,2,1
BAELISH, Knowledge is power.,2,1
CERSEI, Seize him. (Cersei’s guards seize Baelish). Cut his throat. (A guard holds a knife to Baelish’s neck). Stop. Wait. I've changed my mind. Let him go. (The guards let Baelish go). Step back three paces. Turn around. Close your eyes. (The guards do as Cersei says). (To Baelish) Power is power. Do see if you can take some time away from your coins and your whores to locate the Stark girl for me. I would very much appreciate it.,2,1
CUT TO, NORTH,2,1
ROBB, You're Ser Alton Lannister?,2,1
ALTON," I am, Your Grace.",2,1
ROBB," I offer your cousins peace if they meet my terms. First, your family must release my sisters. Second, my father's bones must be returned to us so he may rest beside his brother and sister in the crypts beneath Winterfell. And the remains of all those who died in his service must also be returned. Their families can honor them with proper funerals.",2,1
ALTON," An honorable request, Your Grace.",2,1
ROBB," Third... Joffrey and the Queen Regent must renounce all claim to dominion of the North. From this time, till the end of time, we are a free and independent kingdom.",2,1
SER RODRIK, The King in the North.,2,1
THE OTHERS AT THE TABLE, King in the North.,2,1
ROBB," Neither Joffrey nor any of his men shall set foot in our lands again. If he disregards this command, he shall suffer the same fate as my father, only I don't need a servant to do my beheading for me.",2,1
ALTON," These are... Your Grace, these are...",2,1
ROBB," These are my terms. If the Queen Regent and her son meet them, I'll give them peace. If not, I will litter the south with Lannister dead.",2,1
ALTON," King Joffrey is a Baratheon, Your Grace.",2,1
ROBB," Oh, is he? You'll ride at daybreak, Ser Alton. That will be all for tonight.",2,1
THEON," A word, Your Grace?",2,1
ROBB, You don't have to call me ‘Your Grace’ when no one's around.,2,1
THEON, It's not so bad once you get used to it.,2,1
ROBB, I'm glad someone's gotten used to it.,2,1
THEON," The Lannisters are going to reject your terms, you know?",2,1
ROBB, Of course they are.,2,1
THEON," We can fight them in the fields as long as you like, but we won't beat them until you take King's Landing. And we can't take King's Landing without ships. My father has ships and men who know how to sail them.",2,1
ROBB, Men who fought my father.,2,1
THEON," Men who fought King Robert to free themselves from the yoke of the South, just like you're doing now. I'm his only living son. He'll listen to me. I know he will. I'm not a Stark. I know that. But your father raised me to be an honorable man. We can avenge him together.",2,1
CATELYN, You don't want Balon Greyjoy for an ally.,2,1
ROBB, I need his ships. They say he has 200.,2,1
CATELYN, They say a million rats live in the sewers of King's Landing. Shall we rally them to fight for us?,2,1
ROBB, I understand you don't trust Lord Greyjoy.,2,1
CATELYN, I don't trust Lord Greyjoy because he is not trustworthy. Your father had to go to war to end his rebellion.,2,1
ROBB," Yes. And now I'm the one rebelling against the throne. Before me, it was father. You married one rebel and mothered another.",2,1
CATELYN," I mothered more than just rebels, a fact you seem to have forgotten.",2,1
ROBB," If I trade the Kingslayer for two girls, my bannermen will string me up by my feet.",2,1
CATELYN," You want to leave Sansa in the Queen's hands? And Arya, I haven't heard a word about Arya. What are we fighting for if not for them?",2,1
ROBB, It's more complicated than that! You know it is.,2,1
CATELYN, It's time for me to go home. I haven't seen Bran or Rickon in months.,2,1
ROBB, You can't go to Winterfell.,2,1
CATELYN, I beg your pardon?,2,1
ROBB," I'll send Rodrik to watch over the boys, ‘cause tomorrow, you'll ride south to the Stormlands.",2,1
CATELYN, Why in the name of all the Gods -,2,1
ROBB," Because I need you to negotiate with Renly Baratheon. He's rallied an army of 100,000. You know him. You know his family.",2,1
CATELYN, I haven't seen Renly Baratheon since he was a boy. You have a hundred other lords -,2,1
ROBB," Which of these lords do I trust more than you? If Renly sides with us, we'll outnumber them two to one. When they feel the jaws beginning to shut, they'll sue for peace. We'll get the girls back. Then we'll all go home for good.",2,1
CATELYN, I will ride at first light.,2,1
ROBB," We will all be together again soon, I promise.",2,1
CATELYN, You've done so well. Your father would be proud.,2,1
ROBB, (Pauses) Give Lord Renly my regards.,2,1
CATELYN, King Renly. There's a king in every corner now.,2,1
CUT TO, KING’S LANDING,2,1
CERSEI, What is all this?,2,1
JOFFREY," Returning this room to its proper appearance. Say what you will about the Targaryens, they were conquerors. That is a seat for a conqueror. It needs a room to match it, not vines and flowers.",2,1
CERSEI, We can't find Arya Stark.,2,1
JOFFREY," With luck, she's dead in a ditch somewhere.",2,1
CERSEI," Perhaps. But if not, we need her. They'll never give Jaime back to us for Sansa alone.",2,1
JOFFREY, I think they might. They're weak. They put too much value on their women. (Walks towards the throne).,2,1
CERSEI, We need to set our armies to the task of finding her. Send out as many men as we can. I'm sure if you asked grandfather -,2,1
JOFFREY, The King does not ask; He commands. And my grandfather's stupidity in the field of battle is the reason Robb Stark has Uncle Jaime in the first place.,2,1
CERSEI, His life is in danger.,2,1
JOFFREY, We're at war. All our lives are in danger. I heard a disgusting lie about Uncle Jaime. And you.,2,1
CERSEI, Our enemies will say anything to weaken your claim to the throne.,2,1
JOFFREY, It's not a claim. The throne is mine.,2,1
CERSEI, Of course it is. No one believes this foul gossip -,2,1
JOFFREY, Someone believes it. Father had other children? Besides me and Tommen and Myrcella?,2,1
CERSEI, What are you asking?,2,1
JOFFREY, I'm asking if he fucked other women when he grew tired of you. How many bastards does he have running -,2,1
JOFFREY," What you just did is punishable by death. You will never do it again. Never. (Joffrey begins to walk away). That will be all, Mother.",2,1
ROZ," No, no, no, no. Do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound? Ease into it. Slowly, with passion.",2,1
ROZ, Go wash yourselves. Put some clothes on. Both of you are working tonight.,2,1
ROZ," We do things differently here, Daisy. This isn't some five-copper bawdy house in Hayseed Hall.",2,1
DAISY, Haystack Hall.,2,1
ROZ, Wherever you're from. Our establishment doesn't cater to ploughmen and goat herders. (Nods to a man walking past). Lord Olsen. Taste is everything here.,2,1
DAISY, Littlefinger's a fancy man.,2,1
ROZ," Don't call him Littlefinger, he doesn't like it. Lord Baelish.",2,1
ROZ, She pretends she doesn't speak the common tongue so that people will think she's exotic. She grew up just down the road in flea bottom.,2,1
DAISY, She's beautiful.,2,1
ROZ," She's a dumb slut, really, but a lid for every pot. (Janos enters the room). Lord Commander. Good to see you, again.",2,1
ROZ," You do realize this establishment is owned by Lord Petyr Baelish, the King's Master of Coin. Coin which goes in many pockets.",2,1
JANOS, Orders.,2,1
ROZ, Whose orders?,2,1
JANOS, Someone who doesn't care what Littlefinger thinks.,2,1
MHAEGAN," No, you can't!",2,1
MHAEGAN, No! Please! No! Not my Barra! Please. Please.,2,1
JANOS, Enough. Get it done. Kill the bastard.,2,1
JANOS, Give it here.,2,1
GOLD CLOAK," Spread out! Search every house, every room. Look in every room.",2,1
BLACKSMITH, Gendry! His name is Gendry.,2,1
JANOS, Where is the bastard?,2,1
BLACKSMITH," The Night's Watch! Please, stop!",2,1
JANOS, Where?,2,1
BLACKSMITH," They took him up the Kingsroad, heading north!",2,1
JANOS, How will we know him?,2,1
BLACKSMITH, He's got a bull's head helmet. He made it himself.,2,1
JANOS, Find him.,2,1
CUT TO, YOREN’S PARTY,2,1
CERSEI, What are you doing here?,2,2
VARYS, Your father has named Lord Tyrion to (Cersei scoffs) serve as hand in his stead.,2,2
TYRION, You brought this on yourself.,2,2
CERSEI, I’ve done nothing.,2,2
TYRION, Do you understand we’re losing the war?,2,2
DAENERYS, Does it ever end?,2,2
JORAH," Everything ends, even the red waste.",2,2
DAENERYS," (Speaking Dothraki) Rakharo, Aggo, Kovarro.. Take our remaining horses. Find out how far the Red Waste extends before us, and what lies on the other side.",2,2
EDD, All the other wildlings for a hundred leagues have disappeared. Craster’s still here.,2,2
CRASTER," Any man lays a hand on one of my wives, he loses the hand.",2,2
EDD," He marries his daughters, and they give him more daughters.",2,2
JON, What happens to the boys? What does he do with his sons?,2,2
MATTHOS," (Reading a letter) My brother Robert left no trueborn heirs, the boy Joffrey being born of incest between Cersei Lannister, and her brother Jaime Lannister. By right of birth, and blood, I do this day lay claim to the Iron Throne of Westeros.",2,2
STANNIS, Send copies of that letter to every corner of the realm.,2,2
ROBB, I’m sending one of your cousins down to King’s Landing with my peace terms.,2,2
JAIME, You think my father’s going to negotiate with you? You don’t know him very well.,2,2
THEON," We won’t beat them until we take King’s Landing, and we can’t take King’s Landing without ships. My father has ships, and men who know how to sail them.",2,2
ROBB, Men who fought my father.,2,2
THEON, I’m his only living son. He’ll listen to me.,2,2
CATELYN, You don’t want Balon Greyjoy for an ally.,2,2
ROBB, I need his ships.,2,2
CATELYN, He is not trustworthy!,2,2
JOFFREY, I heard a disgusting lie about uncle Jaime… and you. Father had other children?,2,2
CERSEI, What are you asking?,2,2
JOFFREY, How many bastards does he have running around?,2,2
JANOS, Where is the bastard?,2,2
BLACKSMITH, The Night’s Watch! Heading North!,2,2
JAQEN, (Whispers) Boy.,2,2
JAQEN, (Whispers) Lovely boy.,2,2
ARYA, (Stops walking). What do you want?,2,2
JAQEN, A man has a thirst. The man does not drink for a day and a night. A boy could make a friend.,2,2
ARYA, (Walks toward the cave). I have friends.,2,2
RORGE, Give us a beer. Before I skin you.,2,2
JAQEN," A man does not choose his companions. These two, they have no courtesy. A man must ask forgiveness. (Pause). You're called Arry. (Arya nods). This man has the honor to be Jaqen H'ghar. Once of the Free City of Lorath.",2,2
RORGE," Hey, you little shit. Get us beer!",2,2
ARYA, You should have asked nicely.,2,2
RORGE, Come closer. And I'll shove that stick up your bunghole and fuck you bloody.,2,2
JAQEN, (Quietly) The boy has more courage than sense.,2,2
RORGE, Come here!,2,2
GENDRY, Yoren said none of us were should go near of those three.,2,2
RORGE, Come here!,2,2
ARYA, They don't scare me.,2,2
GENDRY, Hmm? Then you're stupid. They scare me.,2,2
ARYA, What are gold cloaks doing this far from King's Landing?,2,2
GENDRY, What are you doing?,2,2
ARYA, They're looking for me.,2,2
GOLD CLOAK, You're in command here?,2,2
YOREN, You're a long way from home.,2,2
GOLD CLOAK, I asked you a question.,2,2
YOREN," Aye, you did. You asked without manners. And I chose not to answer.",2,2
GOLD CLOAK, (Pulls out rolled up paper and hands it to Yoren). I have a royal warrant. For one of these gutter rats you're transporting.,2,2
YOREN," Well the thing is, (Hands back the paper), these gutter rats belong to the Night's Watch now. That puts them beyond the reach of kings and queens.",2,2
YOREN," It's a funny thing. People worry so much about their throats, they forget about what's down low. Now I sharpened this blade before breakfast. I could shave a spider's arse if I wanted to. Or, I could nick this artery in your leg and once it's nicked, there's no one around here who knows how to un-nick it.",2,2
YOREN, We'll just keep that. Good steel is always needed on the wall. Seems you have a choice. You can die here at this crossroads a long way from home. Or you can go back to your city and tell your masters you didn't find what you were looking for.,2,2
GOLD CLOAK, We're looking for a boy named Gendry. (Gendry and Arya look shocked). He carries a bull's head helmet. Anyone turning him over will earn the King's reward. We'll be back. With more men. (To Yoren) And I'll be taking your head home along with that bastard boy.,2,2
CUT TO, KING’S LANDING,2,2
VARYS, My lord.,2,2
SHAE," You make me wait a long time, but your friend keeps me company.",2,2
VARYS, We were just speaking of your bravery in the victory against the Stark auxiliary forces.,2,2
TYRION, It was quite a battle.,2,2
VARYS, I heard you suffered a terrible head wound. The northerners are such fearsome warriors.,2,2
SHAE, And I tell him the story of how we meet.,2,2
VARYS, To find so lovely creature working in your father's kitchen. It almost beggars belief.,2,2
TYRION, (Begins to pour wine). Strange things do happen. You should taste her fish pie.,2,2
SHAE, I don't think Lord Varys likes fish pie.,2,2
VARYS, How can you tell?,2,2
SHAE, I can always tell.,2,2
TYRION, Men like Lord Varys and I can't let our disadvantages get the best of us. We'll make a fisherman of him yet. (Takes a sip).,2,2
VARYS," I am glad your new friend was able to accompany you to the capital. Friends are such an important part of life. Unfortunate that your father didn't want her to come. But rest easy my lord, I am very good at keeping secrets for my good friends.",2,2
TYRION," Your discretion is legendary, where your friends are concerned.",2,2
VARYS," How unspeakable of me to go on and on, when all you want to do is rest. I will leave you. (Kisses Shae’s hand). Welcome to Kings Landing, my dear. The city is made brighter by your presence. We have a council meeting, my lord.",2,2
TYRION, I don't like threats.,2,2
VARYS, Who threatened you?,2,2
TYRION, I'm not Ned Stark. I understand the way this game is played.,2,2
VARYS, Ned Stark was a man of honor.,2,2
TYRION, And I am not. Threaten me again and I will have you thrown into the sea.,2,2
VARYS," You might be disappointed in the results. The storms come and go. The big fish eat the little fish. And I keep on paddling. Come, my lord. We shouldn't keep the queen waiting.",2,2
CERSEI," “From this time until the end of time, we are not part of your realm, but a free and independent Kingdom of the North.” (Rips up the letter). He has more spirit than his father, I'll give him that.",2,2
TYRION," You've perfected the art of tearing up papers. Give him his father's bones back, at least, as a gesture of good faith.",2,2
CERSEI," You'll give the Starks our reply, cousin?",2,2
ALTON," I will, Your Grace.",2,2
CERSEI, Did you see my brother when you were the Starks guest?,2,2
ALTON," I did. They have not broken his spirit, Your Grace.",2,2
CERSEI," If you speak with him, tell him he's not been forgotten.",2,2
ALTON," I will, Your Grace.",2,2
TYRION," Safe travels, cousin.",2,2
TYRION, You have a deft hand with diplomacy.,2,2
CERSEI, If that's everything?,2,2
PYCELLE, (Holding a letter). A raven flew in this morning from Castle Black.,2,2
VARYS, Trouble with the wildlings?,2,2
BAELISH, That's why they're called wildlings.,2,2
VARYS, Somewhat less wild these days. It seems they've stopped killing each other and started following this King-Beyond-the-Wall.,2,2
CERSEI," Another king? How many is that now, Five? I've lost count.",2,2
TYRION, Lord Commander asks that we send more men to man The Wall.,2,2
CERSEI, Perhaps he's forgotten we're fighting a war. We have no men to spare.,2,2
TYRION," Cold winds are rising, and the dead rise with them.",2,2
PYCELLE, The northerners are a superstitious people.,2,2
TYRION," According to the Commander, one of these dead men attacked him in his chambers. (The other stop leaving). Mormont doesn't lie.",2,2
VARYS, How do you kill a dead man?,2,2
TYRION, Apparently you burn him.,2,2
CERSEI," One trip to The Wall and you come back believing in grumpkins and snarks. (Walks away, followed by Varys).",2,2
TYRION," I don't know what I believe, but here's a fact for you. The Night's Watch is the only thing that separates us from what lies beyond the Wall.",2,2
CERSEI, I have every confidence the brave men of the Night's Watch will protect us all.,2,2
CUT TO, BEYOND THE WALL,2,2
EDD," Then I said, if the gods wanted us to have dignity, wouldn't make us fart when we died.",2,2
GRENN, We fart when we die?,2,2
EDD," My blessed mother was holding her own when she left this world. She farted so hard, the whole bed shook.",2,2
SAM," Seems a bit greedy for one man to have so many wives. Wouldn't two, or three, be enough for him?",2,2
EDD, We were having a serious discussion.,2,2
GRENN, Would you look at that.,2,2
SAM, Nothing like the sight of a woman walking away.,2,2
GRENN, I prefer watching them come towards me.,2,2
SAM, I'm sure that's nice too.,2,2
GRENN," Well, there was a milkmaid named Violet on the next farm over from where I grew up. And we were wrestling together from the time we were six years old. And then we got older, the wrestling, uh, (laughs), changed.",2,2
SAM, You were with her? How many times?,2,2
GRENN," Well, as many times as I could.",2,2
SAM, Wish I'd grew up on a farm.,2,2
EDD, We need more potatoes. And get another sack for the sludge. (Sam begins to walk away). Get the turnips too.,2,2
SAME," No. Ghost, no. No. Ghost, away. Shoo. Shoo! (Ghost walks away). (To Gilly) You all right? Did he frighten you?",2,2
GILLY, You shouldn't touch me.,2,2
SAM," Oh, oh. Right. I'm sorry. I just wanted to make sure you weren't hurt. (Long pause).",2,2
GILLY, You're very brave.,2,2
JON, What’re you doing?,2,2
SAM," This is Gilly, she's one of Craster's daughters.",2,2
JON," Hello, Gilly. What’re you doing?",2,2
GILLY, Sam said you could help.,2,2
JON," I'm sorry, Sam knows we're not supposed to -",2,2
SAM," She's pregnant. (Gilly encourages Sam to continue). We have to take her with us, when we leave.",2,2
JON, What? (Stands up).,2,2
SAM, I know it sounds a bit mad.,2,2
JON," No it doesn't sound a bit mad, it's impossible.",2,2
SAM," The Lord Commander, (Jon tries and fails to interrupt Sam), we are sworn to protect -",2,2
JON, Sam we can't take her -,2,2
GILLY," Please sir, please. I can still run if I have to.",2,2
JON, It's just not possible.,2,2
GILLY," I'm going to have a baby, if it's a boy I…",2,2
JON," If it's a boy what? (Gilly looks around and then down, not answering). You want us to risk our lives for you, and you won't even tell us why.",2,2
SAM, Why did you do that?,2,2
JON," Do what, ask her a question?",2,2
SAM, You were cruel.,2,2
JON, Cruel! Sam are you in such a hurry to lose a hand?,2,2
SAM, I didn't touch her!,2,2
JON, No you just want to steal her. What do you think Craster cuts off for that?,2,2
SAM," I can't steal her, she's a person not a goat.",2,2
JON," We're heading deeper and deeper into wildling territory. We can't take a girl with us. Mormont wouldn't have it. And even if he would, what would we do with her? Who's gonna deliver her baby? You?",2,2
SAM," I could try. (Jon looks down, annoyed). What? I've read about it. A bit.",2,2
JON," I'm sorry Sam, we can't help her.",2,2
CUT TO, ESSOS,2,2
JORAH, Khaleesi.,2,2
JORAH, You don't need to see this.,2,2
DAENERYS, He is blood of my blood.,2,2
DAENERYS, Who did this?,2,2
JORAH," Khal Pono perhaps, Khal Jhaqo They don't like the idea of a woman leading a Khalasaar.",2,2
DAENERYS, They will like it far less when I'm done with them.,2,2
IRRI," No! (Speaking Dothraki, to Daenerys) They killed his soul!",2,2
DAENERYS, (Speaking Dothraki) Shh. They cannot kill his soul.,2,2
IRRI, (Speaking Dothraki) They did! They butchered him like an animal. They did not burn his body. (Daenerys kneels to Irri’s level). He can never join his ancestors in the night lands.,2,2
DAENERYS, (Speaking Dothraki) Shh. We will build him a funeral pyre.,2,2
DAENERYS," (Speaking Dothraki) And I promise you, Rakharo will ride with his ancestors tonight.",2,2
CUT TO, IRON ISLANDS,2,2
WOMAN, Is it as you remember my lord?,2,2
THEON, (Removes his jacket). Looks smaller.,2,2
WOMAN," Everything looks bigger when you're a child. I remember my father's cabin, felt like a palace when I was little. Now look at it.",2,2
THEON, (Removes more of his clothes). They'll be waiting for me on the docks.,2,2
WOMAN, Who will?,2,2
THEON," Anyone who matters, (Takes off his shirt), this is a big day for them. They haven't had much to get excited about since I left. It's a hard place the Iron Islands always has been. It's cold and it's wet.",2,2
WOMAN, I love the cold and wet.,2,2
THEON," They say hard places breed hard men, (Unbuttons his pants), and hard men rule the world.",2,2
WOMAN, Then you'll be king before long.,2,2
THEON," (Kneels down). Try smiling with your lips closed. (She does). Hmm, better.",2,2
WOMAN, My father doesn't trust you Iron islanders.,2,2
THEON, (Taking off his pants). I don't blame him.,2,2
WOMAN," He says that you're all reavers and rapers. And that no matter how many women you have, you'll never be satis-",2,2
THEON," Quit talking about your father. He's right about us. Our wives from the Iron Islands, they're for breeding. That's not enough for us. That's why we take saltwives, from the women we capture.",2,2
WOMAN, Capture me! Take me with you when you go ashore. Make me your saltwife.,2,2
THEON, Your place is on this ship.,2,2
WOMAN, Not after you leave. Father will punish me. He'll call me a whore.,2,2
THEON, I haven't paid you.,2,2
CUT TO, KING’S LANDING,2,2
MAN," I barely touched her. And you charge twice as much as every other brothel. And this is what I get, crying.",2,2
BAELISH," One moment, my friend. A moment.",2,2
BAELISH, Please accept my sincerest apologies. Ramka will take good care of you.,2,2
ROZ," I’m sorry, my lord.",2,2
BAELISH, Shhh. Did he hurt you?,2,2
ROZ," No, my lord… It’s Mhaegen.",2,2
BAELISH, Who?,2,2
ROZ," She works for you. She's the one, the girl whose, they killed her baby.",2,2
BAELISH," Ah, yes, that was poorly handled. Sometimes those with the most power have the least grace.",2,2
ROZ," Can't stop thinking about it, I can't sleep. Her poor little baby.",2,2
BAELISH," You know, you remind me of another girl. A lovely thing I once acquired from an Elysium pleasure house. Beautiful, like yourself, and intelligent as yourself. But she wasn't happy. She cried, often. I asked her why but, we didn't have the kind of rapport that you and I have. Yes, it was quite sad. Girls from Elysium pleasure houses are expensive. Extremely expensive. And this one wasn't making me any money. I hate bad investments. Really, I do. They haunt me. I had no idea how to make her happy, no idea how to mitigate my losses. A very wealthy patron, he offered me a tremendous amount of money to let him transform this lovely, sad girl. To use her in ways that never occur to most men. And you know what occurs to most men. I would not say he succeeded in making her happy but my losses were definitely mitigated. (Stands up). Take tonight off to mourn Mhaegen’s child. I’ll see you tomorrow. But you’ll be happy? (Roz nods and smiles). That makes me happy.",2,2
PODRICK, More wine?,2,2
JANOS," Damn it, boy!",2,2
PODRICK," Apologies, my lord.",2,2
TYRION," Leave us, Podrick. I believe we know how to pour our own wine.",2,2
JANOS, (Podrick leaves). Is that your new squire? Could have found you a proper lad.,2,2
TYRION," Myself, I prefer the improper ones.",2,2
JANOS," Hmm, that's a good red. Dornish?",2,2
TYRION," You know your wines, my lord.",2,2
JANOS," That I do. A fine dinner, my lord.",2,2
TYRION," Call me Tyrion, please. I'm sure you're getting used to fine dinners, now that you're a lord.",2,2
JANOS, Maybe I'll hire this cook of yours.,2,2
TYRION,Wars have been started for less.,2,2
TYRION, I heard there was some trouble in Littlefinger's brothel the other night.,2,2
JANOS," Hmm. Nasty business, had to be done.",2,2
TYRION," Yes, of course. City Watch must keep the peace. Only, I hadn't realized peace depended on killing babies.",2,2
JANOS, Orders are orders.,2,2
TYRION, Quite right. Especially the queen's orders.,2,2
JANOS, I never said they were the queen's orders.,2,2
TYRION," No, but who else would want to murder King Robert's bastards? She's always been a jealous woman.",2,2
JANOS, You know your sister better than I do.,2,2
TYRION, You've heard the awful rumors about my brother and sister.,2,2
JANOS, I don't listen to filth.,2,2
TYRION," That's good of you, but you have heard them. I suppose people who do believe that filth, consider Robert's bastards to be better claimants to the throne than Cersei's children.",2,2
JANOS," Joffrey is my king, the rest doesn't interest me. (Sips his wine).",2,2
TYRION, I appreciate your loyalty. Tell me.,2,2
JANOS, I did. And I would again. The man was a traitor. He tried to buy my loyalty.,2,2
TYRION, The fool! He had no idea you were already bought.,2,2
JANOS, Are you drunk? I'll not have my honor questioned by an Imp.,2,2
TYRION," I'm not questioning your honor, Lord Janos. I'm denying its existence.",2,2
JANOS," You think I'll stand here and take this from you, dwarf.",2,2
TYRION," Dwarf? You should have stopped at imp. And yes, you will stand here and take it from me, unless you'd like to take it from my friend here.",2,2
TYRION," I intend to serve as Hand of the King until my father returns from the war, and seeing as you betrayed the last Hand of the King, well, I just wouldn't feel safe with you lurking about.",2,2
JANOS, What are you ta- My friends at court will not allow this. The queen herself -,2,2
TYRION, The queen regent. And you're a fool to believe she's your friend.,2,2
JANOS, We shall hear what Joffrey has to say about this.,2,2
TYRION," No, we shan't.",2,2
TYRION," There's a ship leaving for East Watch by the sea tonight. From there, I'm afraid it's rather a long walk to Castle Black. I hope you enjoy the Wall. I found it surprisingly beautiful, in a brutal, horribly uncomfortable sort of way.",2,2
BRONN," The lads will escort you. The streets aren't safe at night, my lord.",2,2
JANOS, These men are under my command. (Bronn laughs). I command you to arrest this cutthroat.,2,2
TYRION, His name is Bronn... and he is the new commander of the City Watch.,2,2
BRONN, Boys?,2,2
JANOS, I have friends at court! Powerful friends! The king himself made me a lord!,2,2
TYRION, To the new Commander.,2,2
TYRION," If I told you to murder, an infant girl say, still at her mother's breast, would you do it without question?",2,2
BRONN, Without question? No. I'd ask how much.,2,2
CUT TO, WOODS,2,2
LOMMY," If they come back, I say we yield. Gendry's the one they want. I don't want to get caught in the middle of a battle.",2,2
HOT PIE, I'm not afraid of no battles.,2,2
ARYA," If you got within a mile of a battle, you'd fill your pants.",2,2
HOT PIE, I've seen lots of battles. I saw -,2,2
ARYA, Liar.,2,2
HOT PIE, I saw a man kill another man just outside a tavern in Flea Bottom. Stabbed him right in the neck.,2,2
LOMMY, Two men fighting isn't a battle.,2,2
HOT PIE, They had armor on.,2,2
ARYA, So?,2,2
HOT PIE," So, if they got armor on, it's a battle.",2,2
LOMMY," No, it isn't.",2,2
HOT PIE, What's a dyer's apprentice know about battles anyway?,2,2
ARYA," (Gendry walks over to get more water). Gendry's an armorer's apprentice. Hot Pie, tell Gendry what makes it a battle.",2,2
HOT PIE, (Hesitates) It's when they've got armor on.,2,2
GENDRY, Now who told you that.,2,2
HOT PIE, A knight?,2,2
GENDRY, How'd you know he was a knight?,2,2
HOT PIE," Well, cause he got armor on.",2,2
GENDRY, You don't have to be a knight to have armor. Any idiot can buy armor. (Arya smiles).,2,2
HOT PIE, How'd you know?,2,2
GENDRY, ‘Cause I sold armor.,2,2
ARYA, What do the gold cloaks want with you?,2,2
GENDRY, (Turning around) No idea.,2,2
ARYA, You're a liar.,2,2
GENDRY, (Walking to camp fire). You shouldn't insult people that are bigger than you.,2,2
ARYA, Then I wouldn't get to insult anyone. (Follows him).,2,2
GENDRY," Well, I don’t care what any of them want. No good's ever come of their questions.",2,2
ARYA, No good's ever come? Who asked questions before?,2,2
GENDRY, How can someone so small be such a huge pain in my ass?,2,2
ARYA, Who asked questions?,2,2
GENDRY," The Hand of the King. Er, hands of the King. Lord Arryn came first, a few weeks before he died. And then Lord Stark came, a few weeks before he died.",2,2
ARYA, Lord Stark.,2,2
GENDRY, See? Asking me questions is bad luck. (Walks back to river). You'll probably be dead soon.,2,2
ARYA, What did they ask about?,2,2
GENDRY, My mom.,2,2
ARYA, Who's your mom?,2,2
GENDRY, Just my mom. Worked in a tavern. Died when I was little.,2,2
ARYA, And who was your father?,2,2
GENDRY," He could be one of those gold-hatted bastards, for all I know. What about you, anyway? You thought they were after you, why? Did you kill someone, or is it just because you're a girl?",2,2
ARYA, I'm not a girl!,2,2
GENDRY, (Walks back to camp fire). Yes you are. You think I'm as stupid as the rest of them?,2,2
ARYA," Stupider. Night's Watch doesn't take girls, everyone knows that.",2,2
GENDRY, That's true. You're still a girl.,2,2
ARYA, I am not!,2,2
GENDRY," Well, pull your cock out and take a piss then.",2,2
ARYA, I don't need to take a piss… Lommy and Hot Pie can’t know. No one can know.,2,2
GENDRY, They won't. Not from me.,2,2
ARYA, My name's not Arry. It's Arya. Of House Stark. Yoren is taking me home to Winterfell.,2,2
GENDRY, He was your father. The Hand. The traitor.,2,2
ARYA, He was never a traitor! Joffrey is a liar.,2,2
GENDRY," So you're a highborn, then. You're a lady.",2,2
ARYA," No. I mean yes. My mother was a lady, and my sister -",2,2
GENDRY," You were a lord's daughter and you lived in a castle. Look, all that about cocks. I should never have said that. I've been pissing in front of you and everything. I should be calling you milady.",2,2
ARYA, Do not call me milady.,2,2
GENDRY," As milady commands. (Arya pushes him). Well, that was unladylike.",2,2
CUT TO, IRON ISLANDS,2,2
MAN, What you carrying?,2,2
THEON, Pears and oranges. Wine from the Arbor. And the heir to Pyke of the Iron Islands. (The man makes no response). The only living son of Balon Greyjoy. (The man continues to make no response). Me.,2,2
MAN, Don't like wine. Woman's drink. (Returns to his work).,2,2
THEON, I need to get to Pyke.,2,2
MAN, I'll find you a horse.,2,2
YARA, I'm heading that way. I can take you there.,2,2
THEON, I bet you can.,2,2
YARA, You been at sea long? Or were there just no women where you came from?,2,2
THEON, None like you.,2,2
YARA, You don't know what I'm like.,2,2
THEON, You don't know what you're like. You need someone to teach you. Know who I am?,2,2
YARA, You think I offer free rides to every man in jewelry. Lord Greyjoy.,2,2
THEON, Have my things sent up to the castle.,2,2
THEON," You should give me the reins, I'm a better rider than you. I've been on horseback for the last nine years.",2,2
YARA, Nine years. Do you still know your way around a ship? Have these hands ever touched a rope?,2,2
THEON, Don't you worry about my hands. (Theon begins fondling her). The sea's in my blood.,2,2
YARA, Your blood will be in the sea if I don't watch where I'm going.,2,2
THEON," I have a proposal for my father. One that will make him king again. And me after him. You may stay at the castle tonight, if you're lucky.",2,2
YARA, Is that an offer from my future king?,2,2
THEON," An order, from your future king. You can tell your grandchildren about this night.",2,2
YARA, I don't imagine it will be a story fit for children.,2,2
THEON, Father.,2,2
BALON," Nine years, is it? They took a frightened boy. What have they given back?",2,2
THEON, A man. Your blood and your heir.,2,2
BALON, We shall see. Stark had you longer than I did.,2,2
THEON, Lord Stark is gone.,2,2
BALON, And how do you feel about that?,2,2
THEON, What's done is done. I've brought you a proposal from Robb Stark.,2,2
BALON, Who gave you those clothes? (Stands up). Was it Ned Stark's pleasure to make you his daughter?,2,2
THEON," If my clothes offend you, I will change them.",2,2
BALON, It will. (Begins walking forward). That bauble around your neck. Did you pay the iron price for it or the gold? (Theon looks down). I asked a question. Did you pull it from the neck of a corpse you made or did you buy it to match your fine clothes? Iron or gold?,2,2
THEON, Gold.,2,2
BALON, I'll not have my son dressed as a whore. (Balon walks towards the fireplace and looks into it). My fears have come true. The Starks have made you theirs.,2,2
THEON, (Steps forward). My blood is salt and iron.,2,2
BALON," Yet, (Turns around), the Stark boy sends you to me like a trained raven, clutching his message.",2,2
THEON," The offer he makes, is one I proposed.",2,2
BALON, He heeds your counsel?,2,2
THEON," I've lived with him, hunted with him, fought at his side, he thinks of me as a brother.",2,2
BALON," No, not here, (Walks forward), not in my hearing, you will not name him brother. This son of the man who put your true brothers to the sword. Or have you forgotten your own blood?",2,2
THEON, I forget nothing. I remember my brothers. And I remember when my father was a king.,2,2
BALON, I see. I destroy Robb Stark's enemies for him and he will make me King of the Iron Islands once again.,2,2
THEON, I will lead the attack myself.,2,2
BALON," Oh, you will?",2,2
THEON, I'm your son. Your only living heir. Who else?,2,2
THEON, I told you to wait outside. (The person who entered is revealed to be Yara). How did you get past the guards?,2,2
YARA, Anything with a cock is easy to fool.,2,2
BALON, (Puts his arm around her). My dear.,2,2
THEON, Yara?,2,2
YARA," So good to see you, brother. This is a homecoming I'll tell my grandchildren about.",2,2
THEON, She can't lead an attack!,2,2
BALON, And why not?,2,2
THEON, You're a woman!,2,2
YARA, You're the one in skirts.,2,2
BALON," This isn't Winterfell, boy. Your sister took over command of your eldest brother's ship after your new father killed him.",2,2
ALL THREE, (Theon joins a little late). What's dead may never die.,2,2
BALON, (Watching the letter burn in his hand). No man gives me a crown. I pay the iron price. I will take my crown. (Throws the letter in the fire). That is who I am. That is who we have always been.,2,2
THEON, You won't stand a chance against the Lannisters on your own.,2,2
BALON,Who said anything about the Lannisters?,2,2
CUT TO, DRAGONSTONE,2,2
DAVOS, You'll have your gold when we take the treasury at King's Landing.,2,2
SAAN," All these kings fighting for the throne, and this Stannis has the smallest army. Why would I bet on the man with the worst chance?",2,2
DAVOS," Because you're a smart gambler. Stannis has proved himself in war. Twice. His baby brother has never set foot on a battlefield. Neither has the false king, Joffrey.",2,2
SAAN," And yet, they both have larger armies.",2,2
DAVOS, Stannis has just begun the fight. His bannermen will rally to his cause. There's no man in the Seven Kingdoms more honorable than Stannis Baratheon. Or more worthy of loyalty.,2,2
SAAN, What is the world coming to when smugglers must vouch for the honor of kings.,2,2
MATTHOS," Mind your words, pirate. (They all stop walking).",2,2
DAVOS, Matthos.,2,2
SAAN, You think I'm insulted? I am a pirate. I'm an excellent pirate. I don't sail for promises.,2,2
DAVOS," Of course you do. Every time you leave harbor, you're leaving on a promise. A promise that somewhere on the seas, somebody's got some gold and you can take it from them.",2,2
SAAN, That's a promise that always comes true.,2,2
DAVOS," As is mine. You're not the young man, Salladhor. And correct me if I'm wrong: Most pirates don't grow old.",2,2
DAVOS," As is mine. You're not the young man, Salladhor. And correct me if I'm wrong: Most pirates don't grow old.",2,2
SAAN, Only the clever ones.,2,2
DAVOS," You want to spend your last few years on the sea, stealing from Pentoshi cheesemongers and Midanese silk merchants, then go. They're out there waiting for you. That's easy. What I'm offering you is hard. Come with me and plunder the greatest city in Westeros. You'll be the richest man in Lysene. And the most famous. They'll be singing songs about you as long as men have voices to sing.",2,2
SAAN, Salladhor Saan is a good name for songs.,2,2
DAVOS, It is. (Matthos rolls his eyes).,2,2
SAAN," One thing, I want the queen.",2,2
DAVOS, The queen?,2,2
SAAN," Cersei, I want her. I'll sail with your fleet, all 30 of my ships, and if we don't drown at the bottom of Blackwater Bay, I will fuck this blonde queen and I will fuck her well.",2,2
MATTHOS, This war isn't about you. We're not attacking King's Landing so that you can rape the queen.,2,2
SAAN," I'm not going to rape her, I'm going to fuck her.",2,2
MATTHOS, As if she would just let you!,2,2
SAAN, You don't know how persuasive I am. I never tried to fuck you.,2,2
MATTHOS," Stannis is the rightful king, and the Lord of Light. The one true god.",2,2
SAAN," I've been all over the world, my boy, and everywhere I go, people tell me about the true god. They all think they found the right one. The one true god is what's between a woman's legs, and better yet a queen's legs.",2,2
SAAN, I never thought you'd have a true believer for a son.,2,2
DAVOS, He's young yet. I promise you the gold. I promise you the glory. I cannot promise you the queen.,2,2
MATTHOS, You believe your king can win?,2,2
DAVOS, He is the one true king.,2,2
SAAN," You Westerosee are funny people. A man chops off your fingers and you fall in love with him. (They laugh). I'll sail with you, Davos Seaworth. You are the most honest smuggler I ever met. Make me rich.",2,2
DAVOS, Get me to the gates of King's Landing and I will.,2,2
MATTHOS, When will the King have a sail?,2,2
DAVOS, As soon as his God wills it.,2,2
MATTHOS," He's my God too, and yours. But you were too blind to see. (As they walk). Let me teach you how to read.",2,2
DAVOS, Oh you and your mother.,2,2
MATTHOS, It won't take long. You already know the letters. The holy books are much more persuasive than I can be.,2,2
DAVOS," I wish I had a God, truly! I'm not mocking you, but I've seen men pray to every God there is. Pray for wind, pray for rain, pray for home. None of it works!",2,2
MATTHOS, But you always came home.,2,2
DAVOS, I wasn't praying.,2,2
MATTHOS," (They reach their horses). But I was. Every night that you were at sea, I lit a candle and I prayed, for you.",2,2
DAVOS," You want me to have a god, fine. King Stannis is my god. He raised me up and blessed me with his trust. He gave you a future I could never have imagined. You know how to read, you'll be a knight someday. You think your fire god commanded all that? It was Stannis. Only Stannis.",2,2
MATTHOS," (As Davos is mounting his horse). Stannis is my king, but he's only a man.",2,2
DAVOS, Don't tell him that.,2,2
CUT TO, KING’S LANDING,2,2
CERSEI, Lord Janos Slynt was Commander of the City Watch. You had no right to exile him.,2,2
TYRION, I have every right. I am the King's Hand.,2,2
CERSEI, You're serving as the King's Hand until father gets here. I am Queen Regent.,2,2
TYRION," Listen to me, Queen Regent, you're losing the people. Do you hear me?",2,2
CERSEI," Ha, the people. You think I care?",2,2
TYRION," You might find it difficult to rule over millions who want you dead. Half the city will starve when winter comes. The other half will plot to overthrow you. And your gold-plated thugs just gave them the rallying cry, “The Queen slaughters babies.” (Cersei says nothing). You don't even have the decency to deny it.",2,2
TYRION," It wasn't you who gave the order, was it? Joffrey didn't even tell you. Or did he tell you? I imagine that would be even worse.",2,2
CERSEI," He did what needed to be done. (Now loudly). You want to be the Hand of the King? You want to rule? This is what ruling is! Lying on a bed of weeds, ripping them out by the root one by one before they strangle you in your sleep.",2,2
TYRION," I'm no king, but I think there's more to ruling that that.",2,2
CERSEI," I don't care what you think! You've never taken it seriously. You haven't, Jaime hasn't. (Sits down). It's all fallen on me.",2,2
TYRION," (Tries not to laugh). As has Jaime repeatedly, according to Stannis Baratheon.",2,2
CERSEI," You're funny. (Laughs). You've always been funny. But none of your jokes will ever match the first one, will they? You remember... back when you ripped my mother open on your way out of her and she bled to death.",2,2
TYRION, She was my mother too.,2,2
CERSEI," Now they're gone, for the sake of you. There's no bigger joke in the world than that. (Storms out).",2,2
CUT TO, DRAGONSTONE,2,2
DAVOS, Your Grace.,2,2
MATTHOS, Your Grace.,2,2
STANNIS, How did it fare with your pirate?,2,2
DAVOS, Salladhor Saan will join our fleet. 30 ships. His men know how to fight.,2,2
STANNIS," In my experience, pirates prefer fighting unarmed men.",2,2
DAVOS, Does seem the wiser choice.,2,2
STANNIS, It won't be a choice this time. Do you trust him?,2,2
DAVOS," Salladhor Saan is an old friend, I've known him 30 years. I've never trusted him.",2,2
STANNIS," Well if he does his job, he'll have his share. Leave us.",2,2
DAVOS," At once, Your Grace.",2,2
MELISANDRE," The Lord of Light shines through you, young warrior.",2,2
DAVOS, Come.,2,2
STANNIS, What did you say to him?,2,2
MELISANDRE, I told him death by fire is the purest death.,2,2
STANNIS, Why?,2,2
MELISANDRE, Because it is true. You're troubled my king.,2,2
STANNIS, Yeah.,2,2
MELISANDRE, These armies are but toys for the Lord of Light.,2,2
STANNIS, Tell your lord to burn them then.,2,2
MELISANDRE, I tell him nothing! I pray for his commands and I obey.,2,2
STANNIS, My little brother has a hundred thousand men according to the scouts. Men whose allegiance rightly belongs to me.,2,2
MELISANDRE, You must have faith.,2,2
STANNIS," Faith? In a real war, the side with the greater number wins nine times out of ten.",2,2
MELISANDRE, Then we must be the ten.,2,2
STANNIS," I cannot defeat my brother in the field, and I can't take King's Landing without the men he stole.",2,2
MELISANDRE," I have seen the path to victory in the flames. At first, you must give yourself to the Lord of Light.",2,2
STANNIS," I've said the words, damn you! I burnt the idols.",2,2
MELISANDRE, You must give... all of yourself.,2,2
STANNIS, I have a wife. I took a vow.,2,2
MELISANDRE," She's sick. Weak. Shut away in the tower. And she disgusts you. And she's given you nothing. No sons. Only stillborns. Only death. (Whispers in his ear). I will give you a son, my King.",2,2
STANNIS, (Gasps). A son?,2,2
CUT TO, BEYOND THE WALL,2,2
Bran Stark," Every night it's the same: I'm walking, running, but I'm not me. I'm running through the Godswood, sniffing the dirt, tasting blood in my mouth when I've made a fresh kill, howling. Old Nan used to tell me stories about magical people who could live inside stags, birds, wolves.",2,3

Maester Luwin," That's exactly what they were, Bran: stories.",2,3
Maester Luwin," That's exactly what they were, Bran: stories.",2,3
Bran Stark, So she was lying? They don't exist?,2,3
Maester Luwin," Well, they may have done, but they're gone from the world along with much else. These are dreams, Bran, nothing more.",2,3
Bran Stark, No. My dreams are different. Mine are true. I dreamt of my father dying and Rickon had the same dream.,2,3
Maester Luwin," What about all the dreams you had that didn't come true? [removes a link from his chain] This link is made of Valyrian steel. Only one Maester in a hundred wears it on his chain. It signifies that I have studied the higher mysteries, and all who study these mysteries try their hand at spells. I was not different. I was young and what boy doesn't secretly wish for special powers to lift him out of his dull life into a special one, but in the end, for all of my efforts, I got no more out of it than a thousand boys before me. Come on. [tucks Bran back to bed] Maybe magic once was a mighty force in the world, but not anymore; the dragons are gone, the giants are dead, and the children of the forest forgotten.",2,3
Balon Greyjoy, What are our words? [Theon hesitates] Our words?,2,3
Theon Greyjoy," ""We Do Not Sow""",2,3
Balon Greyjoy," ""We Do Not Sow"". We are Ironborn. We're not subjects, we're not slaves. We do not plow the fields or toil in the mines. We take what is ours. Your time with the wolves has made you weak.",2,3
Theon Greyjoy," You act as if I volunteered to go. You gave me away if you remember. The day you bent the knee to Robert Baratheon. After he crushed you. Did you take what was yours then? [Balon slaps Theon] You gave me away! Your boy! Your last boy! You gave me away like I was some dog you didn't want anymore, and now you curse me because I've come home!",2,3
Cersei Lannister, You monster! Myrcella is my only daughter. Do you really think I will let you sell her like a common whore?,2,3
Tyrion Lannister, Myrcella is a princess. Some would say she was born for this.,2,3
Cersei Lannister, I will not let you ship her off to Dorne as I was shipped off to Robert Baratheon!,2,3
Tyrion Lannister, Dorne is the safest place for her.,2,3
Cersei Lannister, Are you mad? The Martells loathe us.,2,3
Tyrion Lannister, That's why we need to seduce them. We're going to need their support in the war your son started.,2,3
Cersei Lannister, She'll be a hostage.,2,3
Tyrion Lannister, A guest.,2,3
Cersei Lannister, You won't get away with this. You think the piece of paper father gave you keeps you safe? Ned Stark had a piece of paper too.,2,3
Tyrion Lannister," It's done, Cersei.",2,3
Cersei Lannister, No.,2,3
Tyrion Lannister, You cannot stop it!,2,3
Cersei Lannister, No!,2,3
Tyrion Lannister," Just how safe do you think Myrcella is if the city falls? Do you want to see her raped and butchered like the Targaryen children? Make no mistake, they will mount her pretty little head on a spike right beside yours.",2,3
Cersei Lannister, Get out! [Pushes Tyrion back onto the stairs] Get out!,2,3
Varys," Power is a curious thing, my lord. Are you fond of riddles?",2,3
Tyrion Lannister," Why, am I about to hear one?",2,3
Varys," Three great men sit in a room; a king, a priest and a rich man. Between them stands a common sellsword. Each great man bids the sellsword kill the other two. Who lives, who dies?",2,3
Tyrion Lannister, Depends on the sellsword.,2,3
Varys," Does it? He has neither crown, nor gold, nor the favour of the gods.",2,3
Tyrion Lannister," He has a sword, the power of life and death.",2,3
Varys," But if it's swordsmen who rule, why do we pretend kings hold all the power? When Ned Stark lost his head, who was truly responsible? Joffrey? The executioner? Or something else?",2,3
Tyrion Lannister, I've decided I don't like riddles.,2,3
Varys," Power resides where men believe it resides. It's a trick, a shadow on the wall, and a very small man can cast a very large shadow.",2,3
Roose Bolton," Five Lannisters dead, for every one of ours. We've nowhere to keep these prisoners. We have barely enough food to feed our own.",2,4
Robb Stark," We're not executing prisoners, Lord Bolton.",2,4
Roose Bolton," Of course, Your Grace. The officers will be useful. Some of them may be privy to Tywin Lannister's plans.",2,4
Robb Stark, I doubt it.,2,4
Roose Bolton," Well, we'll learn soon enough. In my family, we say: ""A naked man has few secrets, a flayed man none.""",2,4
Roose Bolton," Well, we'll learn soon enough. In my family, we say: ""A naked man has few secrets, a flayed man none.""",2,4
Robb Stark, My father outlawed flaying in the North.,2,4
Roose Bolton, We're not in the North...,2,4
Robb Stark, We're not torturing them!,2,4
Roose Bolton," The high road's very pretty, but you'll have a'hard time marching your army down it.",2,4
Robb Stark, The Lannisters hold prisoners of their own. I won't give them an excuse to abuse my sisters.,2,4
Tyrion Lannister, What is the meaning of this? What kind of knight beats a helpless girl?,2,4
Meryn Trant," The kind who serves his king, Imp!",2,4
Bronn," Careful now, we don't want to get blood all over your pretty white cloak.",2,4
Tyrion Lannister, Someone get the girl something to cover herself with. [Sandor Clegane gives Sansa his cloak] She's to be your Queen. Have you no regard for her honour?,2,4
Joffrey Baratheon, I'm punishing her.,2,4
Tyrion Lannister," For what crimes? She did not fight her brother's battle, you halfwit!",2,4
Joffrey Baratheon, You can't talk to me like that! The king can do as he likes!,2,4
Tyrion Lannister, The Mad King did as he liked. Has your Uncle Jaime ever told you what happened to him?,2,4
Meryn Trant, No one threatens His Grace in the presence of the Kingsguard!,2,4
Tyrion Lannister," I'm not threatening the king, ser. I'm educating my nephew. Bronn, the next time Ser Meryn speaks, kill him. That was a threat. See the difference?!",2,4
Tyrion Lannister, I apologize for my nephew's behavior. Tell me the truth. Do you want an end to this engagement?,2,4
Sansa Stark," I am loyal to King Joffrey, my one true love.",2,4
Tyrion Lannister, Lady Stark. You may survive us yet.,2,4
Stannis Baratheon," Lady Stark, I had not thought to find you in the Stormlands.",2,4
Catelyn Stark," I had not thought to be here, Lord Stannis.",2,4
Renly Baratheon, Can that truly be you?,2,4
Stannis Baratheon, Who else might it be?,2,4
Renly Baratheon," When I saw your standard, I couldn't be sure. Whose banner is that?",2,4
Stannis Baratheon, My own.,2,4
Renly Baratheon," I suppose if we use the same one, the battle will be terribly confusing. Why is your stag on fire?",2,4
Melisandre, The king has taken for his sigil the fiery heart of the Lord of Light.,2,4
Renly Baratheon," Ah, you must be this fire priestess we hear so much about. Ah brother, now I understand why you found religion in your old age!",2,4
Stannis Baratheon," Watch yourself, Renly!",2,4
Renly Baratheon," No, no, I'm relieved. I never really believed you were a fanatic; charmless, rigid, a bore, yes, but not a godly man.",2,4
Melisandre," You should kneel before your brother. He is the Lord's Chosen, born amidst salt and smoke.",2,4
Renly Baratheon, 'Born amidst salt and smoke'? Is he a ham?,2,4
Stannis Baratheon, That's twice I've warned you.,2,4
Catelyn Stark," Listen to yourselves! If you were sons of mine, I would knock your heads together and lock you in a bedchamber together until you remember you're brothers.",2,4
Stannis Baratheon," It is strange to find you beside my brother, Lady Stark. Your husband was a supporter of my claim; Lord Eddard's integrity cost him his head. And you sit beside this pretender and chastise me?",2,4
Catelyn Stark, We share a common enemy!,2,4
Stannis Baratheon, The Iron Throne is mine by right. All those who deny that are my foes.,2,4
Renly Baratheon," The whole realm denies it, from Dorne to the Wall. Old men deny it with their death rattles and unborn children deny it in their mothers' wombs. No one wants you for their king. You never wanted any friends, brother, but a man without friends is a man without power.",2,4
Stannis Baratheon," For the sake of the mother who bore us, I will give you this one night to reconsider. Strike your banners, come to me before dawn and I will grant you your old seat on the Council. I'll even name you my heir, until a son is born to me. Otherwise I shall destroy you.",2,4
Renly Baratheon," Look across those fields, brother. Can you see all those banners?",2,4
Stannis Baratheon, You think a few bolts of cloth will make you king?,2,4
Renly Baratheon, No. The men holding those bolts of cloth will make me king!,2,4
Stannis Baratheon," We shall see, Renly. Come the dawn, we shall see.",2,4
Melisandre," Look to your sins, Lord Renly. The night is dark and full of terrors.",2,4
Renly Baratheon, Would you believe? I loved him once.,2,4
Lancel Lannister, I am a Knight!,2,4
Tyrion Lannister," An anointed Knight, yes. Tell me, did Cersei have you knighted before or after she took you into her bed? [Lancel is dumbstruck] What? Nothing to say? No more warnings for me, Ser?",2,4
Lancel Lannister, You will withdraw these filthy accusations!,2,4
Tyrion Lannister, Have you ever given any thought to what King Joffrey will have to say when he finds out you have been bedding his mother?,2,4
Lancel Lannister, It's not my fault!,2,4
Tyrion Lannister," Did she take you against your will? Can you not defend yourself, Knight?",2,4
Lancel Lannister," Your own father, Lord Tywin, when I was named the King's squire, he told me to obey her in everything!",2,4
Tyrion Lannister," Did he tell you to fuck her, too?",2,4
Lancel Lannister," I only meant, I did as I was bid. I...",2,4
Tyrion Lannister," Hated every moment of it, is that what you'll have me believe? A high place in court, a knighthood, my sister's legs spreading open for you at night! Oh yes, it must have been terrible! Wait here, His Grace will want to hear this.",2,4
Lancel Lannister," Mercy! Mercy, my Lord! I beg you!",2,4
Tyrion Lannister, Save it for Joffrey; he loves a good grovel.,2,4
Lancel Lannister," My Lord, it was your sister's bidding, the Queen. I'll leave the city at once, I swear.",2,4
Tyrion Lannister," No, I think not.",2,4
Lancel Lannister, My Lord?,2,4
Tyrion Lannister," You heard me. My father told you to obey my sister. Obey her. Stay close to her side. Keep her trust. Pleasure her whenever she requires. No one ever need know as long as you keep faith with me. I want to know what Cersei is doing, where she goes, who she sees, what they talk of, everything and you will tell me.",2,4
Lancel Lannister," [kneels] Yes, my lord, I will. I swear it as you command.",2,4
Tyrion Lannister," Oh rise, rise. Let us drink to our understanding. Oh, you don't have a cup. Oh, well. Smile, cousin. My sister is a beautiful woman. And it's all for the good of the realm. Go back and tell her that I beg her forgiveness, that I want no more conflict between us and that henceforth I shall do nothing without her consent.",2,4
Lancel Lannister," But, her demands...",2,4
Tyrion Lannister," Oh, I'll give her Pycelle.",2,4
Lancel Lannister, You will?,2,4
Tyrion Lannister," Yes, I'll release him in the morning. Cersei can keep him as a pet if she wants, but I will not have him on the council. I could swear that I had not harmed a single hair on his head, but that would not, strictly speaking, be true.",2,4
Margaery Tyrell, [looking at Renly's corpse] He was very handsome.,2,5
Petyr Baelish," He was, Your Grace.",2,5
Margaery Tyrell," ""Your Grace"". Calling yourself King doesn't make you one. If Renly wasn't a King, I wasn't a Queen.",2,5
Petyr Baelish, Do you want to be a Queen?,2,5
Margaery Tyrell, No. I want to be the Queen.,2,5
Stannis Baratheon, What is it?,2,5
Davos Seaworth," I'm sorry about your brother, Your Grace. I wanted to let you know people grieve for him.",2,5
Stannis Baratheon," Fools love a fool. I grieve for him as well, for the boy he was, not the man he grew to be.",2,5
Arya Stark, [about Robb] They call him 'The Young Wolf'.,2,5
Tywin Lannister, And?,2,5
Arya Stark, They say he rides into battle on the back of a giant direwolf. They say he can turn into a wolf himself when he wants. They say he can't be killed.,2,5
Tywin Lannister, And do you believe them?,2,5
Arya Stark," No, my lord. Anyone can be killed.",2,5
Brienne of Tarth," Once you're safely back amongst your own people, will you give me leave to go, My Lady?",2,5
Catelyn Stark, You mean to kill Stannis.,2,5
Brienne of Tarth, I swore a vow.,2,5
Catelyn Stark, But Stannis has a great army around him. His own guards are sworn to keep him safe.,2,5
Brienne of Tarth, I'm as good as any of them. I should never have fled.,2,5
Catelyn Stark, Renly's death was no fault of yours. You served him bravely.,2,5
Brienne of Tarth, I only held him that once as he was dying.,2,5
Catelyn Stark," He's gone, Brienne. You serve nothing and no one by following him into the earth. Renly's enemies are Robb's enemies as well.",2,5
Brienne of Tarth," I do not know your son, My Lady, but I could serve you if you would have me. You have courage. Not battle courage perhaps, but, I don't know, a woman's kind of courage. And I think that when the time comes, you will not hold me back. Promise me that you will not hold me back from Stannis.",2,5
Catelyn Stark," When the time comes, I will not hold you back.",2,5
Brienne of Tarth," Then I am yours, My Lady. I will shield your back and will give my life for yours if it comes to that. I swear it by the Old Gods and the New.",2,5
Catelyn Stark," I vow that you shall always have a place in my home and at my table, and that I shall ask no service of you that might bring you dishonor. I swear it by the Old Gods and the New.",2,5
Joffrey Baratheon, [After barely escaping the angry mob] Traitors! I'll have all their heads!,2,6
Tyrion Lannister," Oh, you blind, bloody fool.",2,6
Joffrey Baratheon, You can't insult me!,2,6
Tyrion Lannister," We've had vicious kings and we've had idiot kings, but I don't know if we've ever been cursed with a vicious idiot for a king.",2,6
Joffrey Baratheon, Y-you can't...,2,6
Tyrion Lannister," I can, I am!",2,6
Joffrey Baratheon, They attacked me!,2,6
Tyrion Lannister," They threw a cow pie at you, so you decided to kill them all? They're starving, you fool! All because of the war you started.",2,6
Joffrey Baratheon, YOU'RE TALKING TO A KING!!!,2,6
Tyrion Lannister, [slaps Joffrey] And now I've struck a king! Did my hand fall from my wrist? Where is the Stark girl?,2,6
Joffrey Baratheon, Let them have her!,2,6
Tyrion Lannister," If she dies, you'll never get your uncle Jaime back. You owe him quite a bit, you know.",2,6
Theon Greyjoy, I've taken your castle!,2,6
Bran Stark, Theon?,2,6
Theon Greyjoy, It's Prince Theon now. Get up! You have to get dressed. I've taken Winterfell. I took it. I'm occupying it. I sent men over the walls with grappling claws and ropes.,2,6
Bran Stark, Why?,2,6
Theon Greyjoy, To take the castle.,2,6
Bran Stark, You went with Robb.,2,6
Theon Greyjoy, And he sent me back to Pyke. I'm a Greyjoy. I can't fight for Robb and my father both. Where's Hodor?,2,6
Bran Stark, I don't know.,2,6
Theon Greyjoy, [To Dagmer] Find the halfwit. My men are bringing your people into the courtyard.,2,6
Bran Stark, Why?,2,6
Theon Greyjoy, So you and I can go down and tell them how you've yielded Winterfell to me.,2,6
Bran Stark, I won't!,2,6
Theon Greyjoy, Yes you will.,2,6
Bran Stark, I won't! I'll never yield. I'll fight you and throw you out.,2,6
Theon Greyjoy, The castle is mine but these people are still yours. You'll yield to keep them safe. To keep them alive. That's what a good lord would do. Think carefully about what you want to say.,2,6
Bran Stark, Theon. [Theon turns back to Bran.] Did you hate us the whole time?,2,6
Theon Greyjoy, Ser Rodrik! I sentence you to death!,2,6
Bran Stark, No! You said no harm would come to them if I yielded!,2,6
Theon Greyjoy, The old man couldn't keep his mouth shut.,2,6
Maester Luwin, I urge you not to make a hasty decision.,2,6
Theon Greyjoy," He disrespected me in front of my men! That was his decision, not mine.",2,6
Maester Luwin," He's worth more to you alive than dead. The Starks will pay. Please, Theon, think on what you do.",2,6
Theon Greyjoy," You'll address me as Prince Theon, or you'll be next.",2,6
Dagmer Cleftjaw, Come!,2,6
Bran Stark, No!,2,6
Rickon Stark, No!,2,6
Bran Stark," Theon! Please! Rodrik! Please stop, please!",2,6
Rodrik Cassel, He who passes the sentence should swing the sword!,2,6
Bran Stark, I'm begging you!,2,6
Rodrik Cassel, Coward!,2,6
Bran Stark, STOP! Stop right now!,2,6
Theon Greyjoy," You don't give commands anymore, little Lord.",2,6
Bran Stark, Please stop!,2,6
Rodrik Cassel," Hush now, child. I'm off to see your father.",2,6
Bran Stark," You said no harm would come! You said no harm would come to them, please!",2,6
Theon Greyjoy," Any last words, old man?",2,6
Rodrik Cassel," Gods help you, Theon Greyjoy. Now, you are truly lost.",2,6
Bran Stark, Please don't! I'll do anything! Please!,2,6
Rickon Stark," No, please stop it!",2,6
Daenerys Targaryen," I am Daenerys Stormborn, of the blood of Old Valyria and I will take what is mine, with fire and blood!",2,6
Robb Stark, This cannot be true.,2,6
Roose Bolton," We've had ravens from White Harbour, Barrowtown and the Dreadfort, my lord. I'm afraid it is true.",2,6
Robb Stark, Why? Why would Theon...,2,6
Roose Bolton, Because the Greyjoys are treasonous whores.,2,6
Robb Stark, My brothers?,2,6
Roose Bolton, We've heard nothing of them...but Rodrik Cassell is dead.,2,6
Catelyn Stark," I told you, never trust a Greyjoy!",2,6
Robb Stark, I must go north at once.,2,6
Roose Bolton," There's still a war to win, Your Grace!",2,6
Robb Stark, How can I call myself 'King' if I can't hold my own castle? How can I ask men to follow me if...,2,6
Roose Bolton, You are a king! And that means you don't have to do everything yourself.,2,6
Catelyn Stark, Let me go and talk to Theon.,2,6
Robb Stark," There will be no talk, he will die for this!",2,6
Roose Bolton," Theon holds the castle with a skeleton crew. Let me send word to my bastard son at the Dreadfort; he can raise a few hundred men and retake Winterfell before the new moon. We have the Lannisters on the run; if you march all the way back north now, you lose what you gained. My boy would be honoured to bring you Prince Theon's head.",2,6
Robb Stark," Tell your son Bran and Rickon's safety is paramount. And Theon...I want him brought to me alive. I want to look him in the eye and ask him why, and then I will take his head myself!",2,6
Jorah Mormont, I shouldn't have left you alone with these people.,2,7
Daenerys Targaryen, These people?,2,7
Jorah Mormont, They are not to be trusted.,2,7
Daenerys Targaryen," Who is to be trusted? Who are my people? The Targaryens? I only knew one: my brother, and he would have let a thousand men rape me if it would have gotten him the crown. The Dothraki? Most of them turned on me the day that Khal Drogo fell from his horse.",2,7
Daenerys Targaryen," Who is to be trusted? Who are my people? The Targaryens? I only knew one: my brother, and he would have let a thousand men rape me if it would have gotten him the crown. The Dothraki? Most of them turned on me the day that Khal Drogo fell from his horse.",2,7
Jorah Mormont, Your people are in Westeros.,2,7
Daenerys Targaryen, The people in Westeros don't know I'm alive!,2,7
Jorah Mormont, They will soon enough.,2,7
Daenerys Targaryen, And then what? They'll pray for my return? They'll wave dragon banners and shout my name? That's what my brother believed and he's a fool.,2,7
Jorah Mormont," You are not your brother. Trust me, Khaleesi.",2,7
Daenerys Targaryen," There it is: trust me. And it's you I should trust, Ser Jorah? Only you? I don't need trust any longer. I don't want it and I don't have room for it.",2,7
Daenerys Targaryen," There it is: trust me. And it's you I should trust, Ser Jorah? Only you? I don't need trust any longer. I don't want it and I don't have room for it.",2,7
Jorah Mormont, You are too young to be so...,2,7
Daenerys Targaryen, And you are too familiar!,2,7
Jorah Mormont," Forgive me, Khaleesi. No one can survive in this world without help. No one. Let me help you, please. Tell me how.",2,7
Daenerys Targaryen, Find my dragons.,2,7
Tywin Lannister," Wolfsbane, a rare substance. This is no common assassin.",2,7
Gregor Clegane, We hung twenty men last night.,2,7
Tywin Lannister," I don't care if you hanged a hundred. A man tried to kill me. I want his name, and I want his head.",2,7
Gregor Clegane," We think it was an infiltrator, from the Brotherhood Without Banners.",2,7
Tywin Lannister," A pretentious name for a band of outlaws. We can't allow rebels behind our lines to harass us with impunity; we look like fools, and they look like heroes. That's how kings fall. I want them dead, every one.",2,7
Gregor Clegane, Killing them isn't the problem. It's finding them.,2,7
Tywin Lannister," You gone soft, Clegane? I always thought you had a talent for violence. Burn the villages, burn the farms. Let them know what it means to choose the wrong side.",2,7
Tyrion Lannister," It's just you, me and Joffrey, the ""Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm"".",2,7
Cersei Lannister, I'm sure you'll make a point eventually.,2,7
Tyrion Lannister, He needs to start acting like a king! This war you started is coming to our doorstep and if the entire city wants Joffrey dead...,2,7
Cersei Lannister, I'm not the one giving the boy whores to abuse!,2,7
Tyrion Lannister, I thought the girls might help him.,2,7
Cersei Lannister, Did you?,2,7
Tyrion Lannister, I was wrong! If we can't control him...,2,7
Cersei Lannister, Do you think I haven't tried? He doesn't listen to me!,2,7
Tyrion Lannister, [nodding] It's hard to put a leash on a dog once you've put a crown on its head.,2,7
Cersei Lannister," I always hoped he'd be like Jaime. He looks like him, in a certain light.",2,7
Tyrion Lannister, The boy's more Robert than Jaime.,2,7
Cersei Lannister," Robert was a drunken fool, but he didn't enjoy cruelty. Sometimes, I wonder...",2,7
Tyrion Lannister, What?,2,7
Cersei Lannister, If this is the price for what we've done. For our sins.,2,7
Tyrion Lannister, Sins? The Targaryens...,2,7
Cersei Lannister," Wed brother and sister for hundreds of years, I know. It's what Jaime and I would say to each other in our moments of doubt. It's what I told Ned Stark when he was stupid enough to confront me. Half the Targaryens went mad, didn't they? What's the saying? ""Every time a Targaryen is born, the gods flip a coin.""",2,7
Tyrion Lannister," You've beaten the odds. Tommen and Myrcella are good, decent children, both of them.",2,7
Jaime Lannister," Come to say goodbye, Lady Stark? I believe it's my last night in this world. [looks at Brienne] Is that a woman?",2,7
Catelyn Stark, Do you hear them out there? They want your head.,2,7
Jaime Lannister," Well, old Lord Karstark doesn't seem to like me.",2,7
Catelyn Stark, You strangled his son with your chains.,2,7
Jaime Lannister," Oh, oh. Was he the one on guard duty? He was in my way. Any knight would have done the same.",2,7
Catelyn Stark, You are no knight. You have forsaken every vow you ever took.,2,7
Jaime Lannister," So many vows. They make you swear and swear. Defend the King, obey the King, obey your father, protect the innocent, defend the weak. But what if your father despises the King? What if the King massacres the innocent? It's too much. No matter what you do, you're forsaking one vow or another. Where did you find this beast?",2,7
Catelyn Stark," She is a truer knight than you will ever be, Kingslayer.",2,7
Jaime Lannister," Kingslayer. And what a king he was! Here's to Aerys Targaryen, the second of his name, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, Protector of the Realm, and to the sword I shoved in his back!",2,7
Catelyn Stark, You are a man without honor.,2,7
Jaime Lannister," Do you know I've never been with any woman but Cersei? So in my own way, I have more honor than poor old dead Ned. What was the name of the bastard he fathered?",2,7
Catelyn Stark, Brienne.,2,7
Jaime Lannister," No, that wasn't it. Snow, a bastard from the North. Now when, when good old Ned came home with some whore's baby, did you pretend to love it? No. You're not very good at pretending. You're an honest woman. You hated that boy, didn't you? How could you not hate him? The walking, talking reminder that the honorable Lord Eddard Stark fucked another woman.",2,7
Catelyn Stark, [to Brienne] Your sword.,2,7
Theon Greyjoy, You should be proud of your brother's achievement. I took the great castle of Winterfell with 20 men.,2,8
Yara Greyjoy," You're a great warrior. I saw the bodies above your gates. Which one gave you the tougher fight, the cripple or the six-year-old?",2,8
Theon Greyjoy, I treated the Stark boys with honor and they repaid me with treachery.,2,8
Yara Greyjoy, You treated them with honor by butchering them?,2,8
Theon Greyjoy," Before I had to kill them, I treated them...",2,8
Yara Greyjoy," You seized their home, as is your right. We're Ironborn; we take what we need.",2,8
Theon Greyjoy, Exactly.,2,8
Yara Greyjoy, Then you made them prisoners in their home and they ran away. Is that treachery? I'd call it bravery.,2,8
Theon Greyjoy, They made me a promise–,2,8
Yara Greyjoy, Your little boy prisoners made you a promise and you got mad when they broke it? Are you the dumbest cunt alive?,2,8
Theon Greyjoy, Don't call me a–,2,8
Yara Greyjoy, A cunt. A dumb cunt who killed the only two Starks in Winterfell. You know how valuable those boys were?,2,8
Theon Greyjoy," If I hadn't killed them, the Northerners would think me weak.",2,8
Yara Greyjoy, You are weak. And you're stupid.,2,8
Davos Seaworth, I understand why the older families look down at me.,2,8
Stannis Baratheon, Do you? Why?,2,8
Davos Seaworth, My father was a crabber.,2,8
Stannis Baratheon, And?,2,8
Davos Seaworth, Sons of lords don't like to break bread with sons of crabbers; our hands stink.,2,8
Stannis Baratheon, And where were those lords when Storm's End starved?!,2,8
Davos Seaworth, Many fought bravely for your brother. Many fought for the Mad King.,2,8
Stannis Baratheon, You defend these men who insult you behind your back.,2,8
Davos Seaworth, Some are happy to do it to my face.,2,8
Stannis Baratheon," We were forgotten. Robert and Ned Stark, they were the heroes, the glorious rebels. Marching from battle to battle, liberating towns from the yoke of the Mad King while I held Storm's End with 500 men.",2,8
Davos Seaworth," No one's forgotten, your Grace.",2,8
Stannis Baratheon, No? Robert did. He gave Storm's End to Renly after the war. Renly never fought a day in his life!,2,8
Davos Seaworth, He was only a boy.,2,8
Stannis Baratheon," Then why give him Storm's End? First, we ate the horses. We weren't riding anywhere, not with the castle surrounded. We couldn't feed them, so fine. The horses, then the cats. I've never liked cats, so fine. I do like dogs, good animals, loyal, but we ate them too. Then the rats. The night before you slipped through, I thought my wife was dying. She couldn't speak anymore, she was so frail. And then you made it through the lines, slipped right through in your little black sail boat with your onions...",2,8
Davos Seaworth," And some potatoes. Some salted beef, I believe.",2,8
Stannis Baratheon, Every man at Storm's End wanted to kiss you that night.,2,8
Davos Seaworth, I was relieved they did not.,2,8
Stannis Baratheon," Robert told me to hold Storm's End, so I held it. Then he told me he was giving it to Renly, so I gave it up. Insult or no, I gave it up because Robert was my older brother and he was the king and I've always done my duty. But now, I am the rightful king by every law of Westeros. And when I sit the Iron Throne, you will be my Hand.",2,8
Davos Seaworth," Your Grace, I pray I serve you well.",2,8
Stannis Baratheon, I expect you'll be the first crabber's son to wear the badge.,2,8
Cersei Lannister, Do you think I'm an idiot?,2,8
Tyrion Lannister, I'd say you possess above average intelligence...,2,8
Cersei Lannister, You shipped off my only daughter. Now you want to send my eldest son to the battlefield to die?,2,8
Tyrion Lannister," He'll have his Kingsguard protecting him, he has the finest armour gold can buy; he needs to be out there. The men will fight more fiercely seeing their King fighting beside them, instead of hiding behind his mother's skirts.",2,8
Cersei Lannister, Do you know why Varys is so dangerous?,2,8
Tyrion Lannister, Because he has thousands of spies in his employ? Because he knows everything we do before we do it?,2,8
Cersei Lannister, Because he doesn't have a cock.,2,8
Tyrion Lannister, Neither do you.,2,8
Cersei Lannister," Perhaps I'm dangerous, too. You, on the other hand, are as big a fool as every other man. That little worm between your legs does half your thinking for you.",2,8
Tyrion Lannister, It's not that little. [Cersei laughes humourlessly] Why are you laughing?,2,8
Cersei Lannister, Because I'm happy!,2,8
Tyrion Lannister, And why are you happy?,2,8
Cersei Lannister, Because I have your little whore.,2,8
Tyrion Lannister, I thought you preferred blondes.,2,8
Cersei Lannister," Such a droll little fellow. Tell me, have you married this one yet? No? Good, Father will be so pleased!",2,8
Tyrion Lannister, Why do you care who I fuck?,2,8
Cersei Lannister," Because a Lannister always pays her debts. You stole my daughter, you plot to have Joffrey killed.",2,8
Tyrion Lannister," This is madness. Stannis will be here in days, you need me.",2,8
Cersei Lannister," For what? Your skill in battle? Pretty thing, your whore. Lovely body; the bruises will heal in time...",2,8
Tyrion Lannister, Where did you find her?,2,8
Cersei Lannister," Varys isn't the only one who hears whispers. Really, a Lannister lion necklace? You need to hide your secret whores more carefully.",2,8
Tyrion Lannister, You've forgotten the most important thing about whores...,2,8
Cersei Lannister," Oh? Well, you're the expert, tell me.",2,8
Tyrion Lannister," You don't buy them, you only rent them.",2,8
Cersei Lannister," You're usually a better liar, baby brother. This one you like. You like her very much. Could it be love? Don't worry, she'll be treated gently enough... unless Joffrey is hurt, and then every wound he suffers, she'll suffer too. And if he dies, there isn't a man alive who could advise a more painful death for your little cunt.",2,8
Tyrion Lannister, And how do I know you haven't killed her already?,2,8
Cersei Lannister," You'd like to see her? I thought you might. Ser Mandon, bring in my brother's whore.",2,8
Tyrion Lannister," I'm sorry they hurt you. You must be brave. I promise, I will free you.",2,8
Ros, Don't forget me.,2,8
Tyrion Lannister, Never.,2,8
Tyrion Lannister, I will hurt you for this. A day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth... and you will know the debt is paid.,2,8
Cersei Lannister, Get out.,2,8
Joffrey Baratheon, You're the Master of Whisperers. You're supposed to know everything.,2,8
Varys," No man can be in all rooms at all times. I have many little birds in the North, My Lord, but I haven't heard their songs since Theon Greyojoy captured Winterfell.",2,8
Joffrey Baratheon, The Stark forces are distracted. Now is the time to strike.,2,8
Tyrion Lannister," To strike? My dear nephew, you do see these men preparing the walls for siege? You do understand Stannis Baratheon sails this way?",2,8
Joffrey Baratheon," If my uncle Stannis lands on the shores of King's Landing, I'll ride out to greet him.",2,8
Tyrion Lannister," A brave choice, Your Grace. I'm sure your men will line up behind you.",2,8
Joffrey Baratheon," They say Stannis never smiles. I'll give him a red smile, from ear to ear.",2,8
Tyrion Lannister, Imagine Stannis's terror!,2,8
Varys, (deadpan) I am trying.,2,8
Tyrion Lannister, The Lord of Light wants his enemies burned. The Drowned God wants them drowned. Why are all the gods such vicious cunts? Where is the god of tits and wine?,2,8
Varys," In the Summer Isles, they worship a fertility goddess with sixteen teats.",2,8
Tyrion Lannister, We should sail there immediately.,2,8
Joffrey Baratheon," If I tell the Hound to cut you in half, he'll do it without a second thought.",2,9
Tyrion Lannister," That would make me the ""Quarter Man""; just doesn't have the same ring to it. Cut me in half and I won't be able to give the signal. No signal, no plan. No plan and Stannis Baratheon sacks this city, takes the Iron Throne, puts your pinched little head atop a gate somewhere. It might be quite amusing, except my head would be up there too! I've never much liked my head, but I don't want to see it removed just yet.",2,9
Tyrion Lannister," Can I get you some iced milk and a nice bowl of raspberries, too?",2,9
Sandor Clegane," Eat shit, Dwarf.",2,9
Tyrion Lannister, You're on the wrong side of the wall!,2,9
Sandor Clegane, I lost half of my men. The Blackwater's on fire.,2,9
Joffrey Baratheon," Dog, I command you to go back out there and fight!",2,9
Tyrion Lannister," You're Kingsguard, Clegane. We must beat them back, or they're going to take this city! Your King's city!",2,9
Sandor Clegane, Fuck the Kingsguard! Fuck the city! Fuck the King!,2,9
Tyrion Lannister," Men, form up! Men! Men! They say I'm half a man, but what does that make the lot of you?",2,9
Lannister Soldier," The only way out is through the gates, and they're at the gates!",2,9
Tyrion Lannister," There's another way out; I'm going to show you. We'll come out behind them and fuck them in their arses! [the men laugh] Don't fight for your king and don't fight for his kingdoms! Don't fight for honour, don't fight for glory, don't fight for riches, because you won't get any! This is your city Stannis means to sack, that's your gate he's ramming! If he gets in, it'll be your houses he burns, your gold he steals, your women he'll rape. Those are brave men knocking at our door. Let's go kill them!",2,9
Tywin Lannister, The battle is over; We have won!,2,9
Stannis Baratheon, You said you saw my victory in the flames.,2,10
Melisandre, I did. I still see it.,2,10
Stannis Baratheon," The flames lied. And I'm no better than a savage, trusting in a fire god! I fought for your god in Blackwater Bay. I led my men to the gates of the Seventh Hell as their brothers burned alive and for what? An attack from behind by Tywin Lannister and the Tyrells? If you see so much in your flames, why didn't you warn me?",2,10
Melisandre, The Lord of Light only allows me glimpses.,2,10
Stannis Baratheon, You claim to speak for a god!,2,10
Melisandre, Will you quit the war just because you've lost a battle?,2,10
Stannis Baratheon, You talk about war as if you understand it.,2,10
Melisandre, I've been fighting far longer than you.,2,10
Stannis Baratheon, Have you? Show me how you fight! [Stannis seizes Melisandre by the throat and starts throttling her] Show me! Where is your god now? Will he save you? Where is your god?!,2,10
Melisandre, Inside you.,2,10
Stannis Baratheon, I murdered my brother!,2,10
Melisandre, We murdered him. Share the weight with me.,2,10
Stannis Baratheon, He wasn't your brother.,2,10
Melisandre," This war has just begun. It will last for years. Thousands will die at your command. You will betray the men serving you, you will betray your family, you will betray everything you once held dear...and it will all be worth it, because you are the Son of Fire, you are the Warrior of Light. You will sweep aside this pretender and that one; you will be king.",2,10
Theon Greyjoy," I will kill that man. I don't care how many arrows they feather me with, how many spears they run through me, I will kill that horn-blowing cunt before I fall!",2,10
Maester Luwin, They want you to know you're surrounded.,2,10
Theon Greyjoy, I know I'm surrounded. I know that because I stood on the battlements and saw I was surrounded.,2,10
Maester Luwin, They don't want you to sleep. They want to sap your spirit before...,2,10
Theon Greyjoy," Thank you, wise bald man! Thank you for explaining siege tactics to me. [The horn blows again.] No word from my father?",2,10
Maester Luwin, No.,2,10
Theon Greyjoy, Send more ravens.,2,10
Maester Luwin, You killed all the ravens.,2,10
Theon Greyjoy," The first time I saw Winterfell...[Theon trails off as he hears the horn blow again.] The first time I saw Winterfell, it looked like something that had been here for thousands of years, and would be here for thousands of years after I was dead. I saw it and I thought, ""Of course Ned Stark crushed our rebellion and killed my brothers. We never stood a chance against a man who lives here.""",2,10
Maester Luwin, Lord Stark went out of his way to make it your home.,2,10
Theon Greyjoy," Yes I know my captors were so very kind to me, you love reminding me of that! Everybody in this frozen pile of shit has loved reminding me of that. You know what it's like to be told how lucky you are to be someone's prisoner? To be told how much you owe them? And then to go back home to your real father... [Theon begins to shed tears as the horn blows again.] I will kill that man! I swear to the Drowned God, the old gods, the new gods, TO EVERY FUCKING GOD IN EVERY FUCKING HEAVEN, I WILL KILL THAT MAN!",2,10
Maester Luwin," Theon, listen to me. I serve Winterfell. Now Winterfell is yours. I'm bound by oath to serve you.",2,10
Theon Greyjoy," And what's your counsel, trusted friend?",2,10
Maester Luwin," Run. Five hundred Northmen wait outside the walls, you have 20 men. You can't win. Wait for nightfall and run.",2,10
Theon Greyjoy," There's nowhere to run. I'll never make it back to the Iron Islands. And even if I did, even if by some miracle I slipped through the lines and made it home, I'll be a coward. The Greyjoy who ran. The shame of the family.",2,10
Maester Luwin," [In a gentle tone.] Don't go home. Join the Night's Watch. Once a man has taken the black, he is beyond reach of the law. All his past crimes are forgiven.",2,10
Theon Greyjoy, I won't make it to the wall. I won't make it ten feet past the Winterfell gates.,2,10
Maester Luwin," There are ways. Hidden passageways built so the Lords of Winterfell could escape. The road will be dangerous. But with a little luck...The Night's Watch is an ancient, honorable order. You'll have opportunities there.",2,10
Theon Greyjoy, The opportunity for Jon Snow to cut my throat in my sleep!,2,10
Maester Luwin, The opportunity to make amends for what you've done.,2,10
Theon Greyjoy," I've done a lot, haven't I? Things I never imagined myself doing.",2,10
Maester Luwin," I've known you for many years, Theon Greyjoy. You're not the man you are pretending to be. Not yet.",2,10
Theon Greyjoy, You may be right. I've gone too far to pretend to be anything else.,2,10
Bran Stark, Tell us what medicine to get from your chambers.,2,10
Rickon Stark, We'll make you better.,2,10
Maester Luwin, I feel just fine.,2,10
Bran Stark, They burned it down. They burned everything.,2,10
Maester Luwin," Not everything. Not you. But they may come back. You have to go. Put on your warmest clothes, pack as much food as you can carry, and go north.",2,10
Osha, North is the wrong way. Their mother and brother are south.,2,10
Maester Luwin," We don't know where. There are too many enemies in the south. Go to the wall, to Jon. He'll look after you and let your mother know you're safe.",2,10
Bran Stark, I don't want to leave you.,2,10
Maester Luwin," No more than I want to leave you. I pulled you into the world. Both of you. I've seen both your faces almost every day since, and for that I consider myself very, very lucky. Go now with Hodor. Go on. I'll be right here. [Bran and Rickon leave with Hodor.] Osha, you must protect them. You're the only one who can. You may have to protect them against your own kind.",2,10
Osha, I have no great love for my own kind. I'll get you milk of the poppy. Tell me where to find it.,2,10
Maester Luwin, I don't want milk of the poppy.,2,10
Maester Luwin, Do it quickly.,2,10
Samwell Tarly," It's Jon and the Halfhand, they're back!",2,10
Grenn, Two blasts is Wildlings!,2,10
Dolorous Edd," You're not fighting them alone, come on!",2,10
Grenn, Three blasts.,2,10
Dolorous Edd, RUN!,2,10
Samwell Tarly, Wait! Wait for me! Grenn! Edd!,2,10
Tormund Giantsbane, I smell a Crow.,3,1
Lord of Bones, We killed his friends. Thought you'd want to question this one.,3,1
Tormund Giantsbane, What do we want with a baby Crow?,3,1
Ygritte, This baby killed Qhorin Halfhand.,3,1
Tormund Giantsbane, That halfhanded cunt killed friends of mine. Friends twice your size.,3,1
Jon Snow, My father taught me big men fall just as quick as little ones if you put a sword through their hearts.,3,1
Tormund Giantsbane," Plenty of little men tried to put their swords through my heart. And there's plenty of little skeletons buried in the woods. What's your name, boy?",3,1
Jon Snow, Jon Snow... Your Grace.,3,1
Tormund Giantsbane," ""Your Grace?"" Do you hear that? From now on, you'd better kneel every time I fart.",3,1
Bronn, I grow poor protecting you.,3,1
Tyrion Lannister," Poor? Under my patronage, you've become a knight, you've served as commander of the City Watch.",3,1
Bronn, Briefly.,3,1
Tyrion Lannister, I'm sure you've filled your pockets.,3,1
Bronn," And now, my pockets are empty. You've given me a taste for the finer things and if you want me to carry on protecting you, you'll have to pay more.",3,1
Tyrion Lannister, I thought we were friends.,3,1
Bronn," We are but I'm a sellsword. I sell my sword, I don't loan it out to friends as a favor.",3,1
Tyrion Lannister, The badge looks good on you. Almost as good as it looked on me. Are you enjoying your new position?,3,1
Tywin Lannister, Am I enjoying it?,3,1
Tyrion Lannister, I was very happy as Hand of the King.,3,1
Tywin Lannister, Yes. I heard how happy you were. You brought a whore into my bed.,3,1
Tyrion Lannister, It wasn't your bed at the time.,3,1
Tywin Lannister, I sent you here to advise the king. I gave you real power and authority. You chose to spend your days as you always have: bedding harlots and drinking with thieves.,3,1
Tywin Lannister, I sent you here to advise the king. I gave you real power and authority. You chose to spend your days as you always have: bedding harlots and drinking with thieves.,3,1
Tyrion Lannister, Occasionally I drank with the harlots.,3,1
Tywin Lannister," What do you want, Tyrion?",3,1
Tyrion Lannister, Why does everyone assume I want something? Can't I simply visit with my beloved father? My beloved father who somehow forgot to visit his wounded son after he fell on the battlefield.,3,1
Tywin Lannister, Maester Pycelle assured me your wounds were not fatal.,3,1
Tyrion Lannister," I organized the defense of this city while you held court in the ruins of Harrenhal. I led the foray when the enemies were at the gate while your grandson, the king, quivered in fear behind the walls. I bled in the mud for our family. And as my reward, I was trundled off to some dark little cell. But what do I want? A little bloody gratitude would be a start.",3,1
Tywin Lannister," Jugglers and singers require applause. You are a Lannister. Do you think I demanded a garland of roses every time I suffered a wound on a battlefield? Hmm? Now, I have seven kingdoms to look after and three of them are in open rebellion. So tell me what you want.",3,1
Tyrion Lannister," I want what is mine by right. Jaime is your eldest son, heir to your lands and titles. But he is a Kingsguard, forbidden from marriage or inheritance. The day Jaime put on the white cloak, he gave up his claim to Casterly Rock. I am your son and lawful heir.",3,1
Tywin Lannister, You want Casterly Rock?,3,1
Tyrion Lannister, It is mine by right.,3,1
Tywin Lannister," We'll find you accommodations more suited to your name and as a reward for your accomplishments during the battle of Blackwater Bay. And when the time is right, you will be given a position fit for your talents so that you can serve your family and protect our legacy. And if you serve faithfully, you will be rewarded with a suitable wife. And I would let myself be consumed by maggots before mocking the family name and making you heir to Casterly Rock.",3,1
Tyrion Lannister, Why?,3,1
Tywin Lannister," Why? You ask that? You, who killed your mother to come into the world? You are an ill-made, spiteful little creature full of envy, lust, and low cunning. Men's laws give you the right to bear my name and display my colors since I cannot prove that you are not mine. And to teach me humility, the gods have condemned me to watch you waddle about wearing that proud lion that was my father's sigil and his father's before him. But neither gods nor men will ever compel me to let you turn Casterly Rock into your whorehouse. Go, now. Speak no more of your rights to Casterly Rock. Go. [Tyrion walks away] Oh, one more thing. The next whore I catch in your bed, I'll hang.",3,1
Davos Seaworth," Your Grace, you are the rightful king. Not only by blood. You're an honorable man, a just man. And there is still a war to fight.",3,1
Stannis Baratheon, I am fighting.,3,1
Davos Seaworth, By burning prisoners alive?,3,1
Melissandre," How would you punish the infidels, Ser Davos?",3,1
Davos Seaworth," I do not judge people for the gods they worship. If I did, I'd have thrown you in the sea before you ever set foot on Dragonstone.",3,1
Melissandre, I'm not your enemy.,3,1
Davos Seaworth, You are my enemy.,3,1
Melissandre," Was it me you fought on Blackwater Bay? Did I set your ships ablaze? I wasn't there when the wildfire killed our men by the thousands. I could have saved those men. You would have taken the city, Stannis would now sit upon his rightful throne, and you would stand beside him. But I wasn't there because you convinced your king to leave me behind. Do you hear them screaming? All those burning men in the water crying for their mothers, for their gods for help? Until the moment the Blackwater swallowed them. Don't despair, Ser Davos. What I told your son is true. Death by fire is the purest death.",3,1
Davos Seaworth, This woman is evil! She's the mother of demons.,3,1
Stannis Baratheon, Take him to the dungeon and lock him in a cell.,3,1
Davos Seaworth, Your Grace!,3,1
Melissandre," You've chosen the darkness, Ser Davos.",3,1
Davos Seaworth, She will destroy us all!,3,1
Melissandre, I will pray for you.,3,1
Jaime Lannister," You know, it doesn't matter how loyal a servant you are, no one enjoys the company of a humorless mute. Trust me on this. People have been serving me since I was born. You think Lady Stark is going to want a giant towheaded plank following her around for the rest of her life? A week's journey with you and she'll order you to fall on your sword.",3,2
Brienne of Tarth," If Lady Stark is unhappy with any aspect of my service, I'm sure she'll let me know. She's an honest woman.",3,2
Jaime Lannister, For all the good it's done her. How did you come into Lady Stark's service? There's something we can talk about.,3,2
Brienne of Tarth," Not your concern, Kingslayer.",3,2
Jaime Lannister, It had to be recently. You weren't with her at Winterfell.,3,2
Brienne of Tarth, How would you know?,3,2
Jaime Lannister, Because I visited Winterfell. I would have noticed your dour head smacking into the archways.,3,2
Brienne of Tarth, Move.,3,2
Jaime Lannister, Were you pledged to Stannis?,3,2
Brienne of Tarth," Gods, no.",3,2
Jaime Lannister," Ah, Renly. Really? He wasn't fit to rule over anything more important than a 12-course meal.",3,2
Brienne of Tarth, Shut your mouth.,3,2
Jaime Lannister," Why? I lived with him at court since he was a boy, don't forget. Could hardly escape the little tulip skipping down the corridors in his embroidered silks. I knew him far better than you.",3,2
Brienne of Tarth," I knew him as well as anyone. As a member of his Kingsguard, he trusted me with everything. He would have been a wonderful king.",3,2
Jaime Lannister, Sounds like you quite fancied him.,3,2
Brienne of Tarth, I did not fancy him.,3,2
Jaime Lannister," Oh, gods, you did. Did you ever tell him? No, of course not. You weren't Renly's type, I'm afraid. He preferred curly-haired little girls like Loras Tyrell. You're far too much man for him.",3,2
Brienne of Tarth, I'm not interested in foul rumors.,3,2
Jaime Lannister, Unless they're about me. It's all true about Renly. His proclivities were the worst kept secret at court. It's a shame the throne isn't made out of cocks. They'd have never got him off it.,3,2
Brienne of Tarth, Shut your mouth!,3,2
Jaime Lannister," I don't blame him. And I don't blame you, either. We don't get to choose who we love.",3,2
Margaery Tyrell," Lady Sansa, it is my honor to present my grandmother... the Lady Olenna of House Tyrell.",3,2
Sansa Stark," And I was sorry when I heard of Lord Renly's death, Lady Margaery. He was very gallant.",3,2
Olenna Tyrell," Gallant, yes. And charming and very clean. He knew how to dress and smile and somehow this gave him the notion he was fit to be king.",3,2
Margaery Tyrell," Renly was brave and gentle, Grandmother. Father liked him and so did Loras.",3,2
Margaery Tyrell, Grandmother! What will Sansa think of us?,3,2
Olenna Tyrell," She might think we have some wits about us. One of us, at any rate. It was treason. I warned them. Robert has two sons and Renly has an older brother. How could he possibly have any claim to that ugly iron chair? We should have stayed well out of all this if you ask me. But once the cow's been milked, there's no squirting the cream back up her udders. So here we are to see things through.",3,2
Olenna Tyrell," Are you frightened, child? No need for that. We're only women here. Tell us the truth. No harm will come to you.",3,2
Sansa Stark, My father always told the truth.,3,2
Olenna Tyrell," Yes, he had that reputation. And they named him traitor and took his head.",3,2
Sansa Stark, Joffrey. Joffrey did that. He promised he would be merciful and he cut my father's head off. And he said that was mercy. Then he took me up on the walls and made me look at it.,3,2
Margaery Tyrell, Go on.,3,2
Sansa Stark, I.. I can't. I never meant... my father was a traitor. My brother as well. I have traitor's blood. Please don't make me say anymore.,3,2
Margaery Tyrell," She's terrified, Grandmother. Just look at her.",3,2
Olenna Tyrell," Speak freely, child. We would never betray your confidence, I swear it.",3,2
Sansa Stark, He's a monster.,3,2
Olenna Tyrell, Ah. That's a pity.,3,2
Sansa Stark," Please, don't stop the wedding.",3,2
Olenna Tyrell," Have no fear. The Lord Oaf of Highgarden is determined that Margaery shall be queen. Even so, we thank you for the truth. Ah, here comes my cheese.",3,2
Talisa Maegyr," May I help you, Lady Stark?",3,2
Catelyn Stark, No.,3,2
Talisa Maegyr," I'm sorry, I shouldn't have-",3,2
Catelyn Stark, You can't help because a mother makes one for her children to protect them. Only a mother can make them.,3,2
Talisa Maegyr, You've made them before?,3,2
Catelyn Stark, Twice.,3,2
Talisa Maegyr, Did they work?,3,2
Catelyn Stark," After a fashion. I prayed for my son Bran to survive his fall. Many years before that, one of the boys came down with the pox. Maester Luwin said if he made it through the night, he'd live. But it would be a very long night. So I sat with him all through the darkness, listened to his ragged little breaths, his coughing, his whimpering.",3,2
Talisa Maegyr, Which boy?,3,2
Catelyn Stark," Jon Snow. When my husband brought that baby home from the war, I couldn't bear to look at him, didn't want to see those brown stranger's eyes staring at me. So I prayed to the gods ""Take him away, make him die"". He got the pox and I knew I was the worst woman who ever lived. A murderer. I'd condemned this poor, innocent child to a horrible death all because I was jealous of his mother, a woman he didn't even know! So I prayed to all Seven Gods ""Let the boy live. Let him live and I'll love him. I'll be a mother to him. I'll beg my husband to give him a true name, to call him Stark and be done with it, to make him one of us"".",3,2
Talisa Maegyr, And he lived?,3,2
Catelyn Stark," And he lived. And I couldn't keep my promise. And everything that's happened since then, all this horror that's come to my family...it's all because I couldn't love a motherless child.",3,2
Osha," Isn't he ashamed, your brother, needing you to protect him?",3,2
Meera Reed, Where's the shame in that?,3,2
Osha, Any boy his age who needs his sister to protect him is gonna find himself needing lots of protecting.,3,2
Meera Reed, Some people will always need help. That doesn't mean they're not worth helping.,3,2
Edmure Tully," If I may, nephew, I encountered a situation with one of my lieutenants at the Stone Mill which may have some bearing-",3,3
Brynden Tully," Why don't you shut your mouth about that damned mill? And don't call him ""nephew."" He is your king.",3,3
Edmure Tully, Robb knows I meant him no disr-,3,3
Brynden Tully, You're lucky I'm not your king. I wouldn't let you wave your blunders around like a victory flag.,3,3
Edmure Tully," My blunder sent Tywin's mad dog scurrying back to Casterly Rock with his tail between his legs. I think King Robb understands we're not gonna win this war if he's the only one winning any battles. No, there's glory enough to go around.",3,3
Robb Stark, It's not about glory. Your instructions were to wait for him to come to you.,3,3
Edmure Tully, I seized an opportunity.,3,3
Robb Stark, What value was the mill?,3,3
Edmure Tully, The Mountain was garrisoned across the river from it.,3,3
Robb Stark, Is he there now?,3,3
Edmure Tully, Of course not. We took the fight to him. He could not withstand us.,3,3
Robb Stark," I wanted to draw the Mountain into the west, into our country where we could surround him and kill him. I wanted him to chase us, which he would have done because he is a mad dog without a strategic thought in his head. I could have that head on a spike by now. Instead, I have a mill.",3,3
Edmure Tully, We took hostages. Willem Lannister. Martyn Lannister.,3,3
Robb Stark, Willem and Martyn Lannister are 14 years old.,3,3
Brynden Tully," Martyn is 15, I believe.",3,3
Robb Stark, Tywin Lannister has my sisters. Have I sued for peace?,3,3
Edmure Tully, No.,3,3
Robb Stark, Do you think he'll sue for peace because we have his... [frowns as he tries to work it out in his head] Father's brother's great-grandsons?,3,3
Edmure Tully, No.,3,3
Robb Stark, How many men did you lose?,3,3
Edmure Tully," 208. But for every man we lost, the Lannisters--",3,3
Robb Stark, We need our men more than Tywin needs his!,3,3
Edmure Tully, I'm sorry. I didn't know.,3,3
Robb Stark, You would have. Right here today at this gathering if you had been patient.,3,3
Brynden Tully, We seem to be running short of patience here.,3,3
Robb Stark, You know who isn't? Tywin Lannister.,3,3
Tywin Lannister," What news of Jaime? [All the others remain silent] Twenty thousand unwashed Northerners have known about his escape for weeks. Collectively, you control more spies and informants than the rest of the world combined. Do you mean to tell me that none of you has any notion where he is?",3,3
Varys," We are trying, my lord.",3,3
Tywin Lannister, Try harder! What do we have then?,3,3
Varys," Robb Stark and most of his bannermen are in Riverrun for the funeral of his grandfather, Lord Hoster Tully. In Stark's absence, Roose Bolton holds Harrenhal, which would make him Lord of Harrenhal, in practice if not in name-",3,3
Tywin Lannister, Let him have it. The name suits our purposes far more than that useless pile of rubble. The Lord of Harrenhal will make a worthy suitor for the widow Arryn.,3,3
Petyr Baelish," For which I am extremely grateful to you, my lord. Lady Arryn and I have known each other since we were children; she has always been positively predisposed towards me.",3,3
Grand Maester Pycelle, A successful courtship would make Lord Baelish Acting Lord of the Vale.,3,3
Petyr Baelish, Titles do seem to breed titles.,3,3
Tywin Lannister," You'll leave for the Eyrie as soon as possible and bring Lysa Arryn into the fold, then the Young Wolf can add his own aunt to the list of people who've taken up arms against him!",3,3
Tyrion Lannister," Far be it from me to hinder true love, but Lord Baelish's absence would present certain problems. The royal wedding may end up being the most expensive event in living memory. Summer had ended, hard days lie ahead, not a good time to leave the crown's finances unattended.",3,3
Tywin Lannister," Fully agreed, which is why I am naming you Master of Coin.",3,3
Tyrion Lannister, Master of Coin?!,3,3
Tywin Lannister, It would appear to be a position that best suits your talents.,3,3
Tyrion Lannister," I'm quite good at spending money, but a lifetime of outrageous wealth hasn't taught me about managing it!",3,3
Cersei Lannister, I have no doubt you will prove equal to this challenge.,3,3
Grand Maester Pycelle," Hear, hear!",3,3
Brynden Tully," After thirty years of fighting, I... I think he'd forgotten what started' it! He asked me to stop calling myself ""Blackfish"". Said it was an old joke, and it was never funny to begin with. I told him, ""People have been calling me 'Blackfish' for so long, I don't remember my real name!""",3,3
Catelyn Stark," Every time he left for the Capitol, or to fight in a campaign, I'd see him off. ""Wait for me, Little Cat"" he'd say, ""Wait for me and I'll come back to you."" And I would sit at this window every day when the sun came up, waiting. I wonder how many times did Bran and Rickon stare across the moors of Winterfell, waiting for me to return?! I will never see them again!",3,3
Brynden Tully," You musn't think it. We don't know it. They could be in hiding. Robb believes they're alive. And, he must go on believing. He's got to remain strong if he's going to prevail, and you must remain strong for him.",3,3
Barristan Selmy," When your brother Rhaegar led his army into battle at the Trident, men died for him because they believed in him, because they loved him, not because they'd been bought at a slaver's auction. I fought beside the last dragon on that day, your Grace. I bled beside him.",3,3
Jorah Mormont," Rhaegar fought valiantly, Rhaegar fought nobly...and Rhaegar died.",3,3
Daenerys Targaryen," Did you know him well, Ser Barristan?",3,3
Barristan Selmy," I did, your Grace. The finest man I ever met.",3,3
Daenerys Targaryen, I wish I had known him...but he was not the last dragon.,3,3
Locke, You think you're the smartest man there is. Everyone alive has to bow to lick and scrape your boots.,3,3
Jaime Lannister, My father...,3,3
Locke," You get in any trouble, all you got to do is say ""My father"" and that's it. All your troubles are gone. Have you got something to say? You don't want to say the wrong thing. You're nothing without your daddy, and your daddy ain't here. Never forget that.",3,3
Locke," Here, this should help you remember!",3,3
Varys," Before all this nastiness, I was going to tell you the story of how I was cut. Do you want to hear it still?",3,4
Tyrion Lannister, I don't know. Do I?,3,4
Varys," As a boy, in Myr, I traveled with a troupe of actors through the Free Cities. One day, a man approached my master with an offer too tempting to refuse. I feared the man meant to use me, as I'd heard some men use small boys, but what he wanted was far worse. He gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak, yet did nothing to dull my senses. With a hooked blade, he sliced me, root and stem, chanting all the while. He burned my parts on a brazier; the flames burned blue, and I heard a voice answer his call. Still dream of that night. Not of the sorcerer, not of his blade...I dream of the voice. Was it a god? A demon? Some conjurer's trick? I don't know,but the sorcerer called and a voice answered. And ever since that day, I have hated magic, and all who practice it. But, you can see why I was eager to aid in your fight against Stannis and his Red Priestess, a symbolic revenge, of sorts.",3,4
Tyrion Lannister," Yes, I feel the need for actual revenge. Against the actual person who tried to have me killed, which will require a certain degree of influence, which...",3,4
Varys," You do not possess at the moment. But influence is largely a matter of patience, I find. Once I had served the sorcerer's purpose, he threw me out of his house, to die. I resolved to live, to spite him. I begged, I sold what parts of my body remained to me, I became an excellent thief. And soon, learned that the contents of a man's letters are more valuable than the contents of his purse. Step by step, one distasteful task after another, I made my way from the slums of Myr to the Small Council Chamber. Influence grows, like a weed. I tended mine, patiently, until its tendrils reached from the Red Keep, all the way across to the far side of the world where I managed to wrap them around something very special.",3,4
Tyrion Lannister, The sorcerer.,3,4
Varys," Hello, my old friend. It's been a long time. I have no doubt, the revenge you want will be yours in time if you have the stomach for it.",3,4
Tywin Lannister, You wanted to speak to me?,3,4
Cersei Lannister," Yes, about Jaime.",3,4
Tywin Lannister, What about him?,3,4
Cersei Lannister, I wanted to make sure we're doing whatever we can to get him back.,3,4
Tywin Lannister," When Catelyn Stark took Tyrion prisoner, what did I do in response?",3,4
Cersei Lannister, You started a war.,3,4
Tywin Lannister," And, if I started a war for that lecherous little stump, what do you think I am doing for my eldest son, and heir?",3,4
Cersei Lannister, Whatever you can.,3,4
Tywin Lannister, Whatever I can.,3,4
Tywin Lannister, You're still here.,3,4
Cersei Lannister, Yes.,3,4
Tywin Lannister, Why?,3,4
Cersei Lannister," Did it ever occur to you that I might be the one who deserves your confidence and your trust, not your sons? Not Jaime or Tyrion, but me? Years and years of lectures on family and legacy, same lecture, really, just with tiny, tedious variations. Did it ever occur to you that your daughter might be the only one listening to them, living by them? That she might have the most to contribute to your legacy that you love so much more than your actual children?",3,4
Tywin Lannister, All right. Contribute.,3,4
Cersei Lannister, The Tyrells are a problem.,3,4
Tywin Lannister," The Tyrells helped us defeat Stannis Baratheon. The Tyrells helped save your life, and your children's lives.",3,4
Cersei Lannister, Margaery has her claws into Joffrey. She knows how to manipulate him.,3,4
Tywin Lannister," Good. I wish you knew how to manipulate him. I don't distrust you because you're a woman. I distrust you because you're not as smart as you think you are. You've allowed that boy to ride roughshod over you, and everyone else in this city.",3,4
Cersei Lannister, Perhaps you should try stopping him from doing what he likes.,3,4
Tywin Lannister, I will.,3,4
Craster," You have one son, don't you, Mormont? I had my 99th. You ever meet a man with 99 sons?",3,4
Craster, And more daughters than I can count.,3,4
Jeor Mormont, I'm glad for you.,3,4
Craster," Are you now? Me, I'll be glad when you and yours have gone.",3,4
Jeor Mormont, As soon as our wounded are strong enough.,3,4
Craster," Ah. They're as strong as they're gonna get. Them that's dying, why don't you cut their throats and be done with it? Or leave them if you've not the stomach, and I'll sort them myself.",3,4
Karl Tanner," Whose throat you gonna cut, old man?",3,4
Jeor Mormont, Wait outside.,3,4
Karl Tanner," It's cold outside, and there's nothing to eat.",3,4
Craster, My wives gave you bread.,3,4
Karl Tanner, There's sawdust in the bread.,3,4
Craster," You don't like it, you go out there and eat the snow.",3,4
Karl Tanner, I'd rather eat what you've got hidden away.,3,4
Jeor Mormont, I told you to wait outside.,3,4
Rast," He's sitting there, drinking our wine, eating his fill while we die!",3,4
Craster, I gave you crows enough. I've got to feed my women!,3,4
Rast," So you admit you've got a hidden larder, then? How else'd you make it through winter?",3,4
Jeor Mormont, Enough! Out!,3,4
Craster, I am a godly man!,3,4
Rast, You're a stingy bastard!,3,4
Craster," Bastard? [Craster takes an axe off the wall] Out with you, you little thief! [To Karl] And you! [To Eddison Tollett] And you! [Craster looks threateningly at everyone] Go sleep in the cold on empty bellies! I'll chop the hands off the next man who calls me bastard!",3,4
Karl Tanner," You are a bastard. A daughter-fucking, wildling bastard.",3,4
Jeor Mormont, The gods will curse us for this! By all the laws...,3,4
Karl Tanner, There are no laws beyond the Wall!,3,4
Karl Tanner," Now show us where he hides the food, or you'll get the same as he did!",3,4
Jeor Mormont, [draws his sword] Unhand her!,3,4
Jeor Mormont, I shall have your head for this...!,3,4
Samwell Tarly, [to Gilly] Quickly. Quickly.,3,4
Gilly, What's happening? I'm not going out there.,3,4
Samwell Tarly," No, we have to go. Now!",3,4
Gilly, Follow me. I know the best way. Come on.,3,4
Rast," Run fast, Piggy, and sleep well! I'll be cutting your throat one of these nights!",3,4
Robb Stark, It took five of you to murder two unarmed squires?,3,5
Rickard Karstark," Not murder, Your Grace. Vengeance.",3,5
Robb Stark," Vengeance? Those boys didn't kill your sons. I saw Harrion die on the battlefield, and Torrhen...",3,5
Rickard Karstark, Was strangled by the Kingslayer. They were his kin.,3,5
Robb Stark, THEY WERE BOYS! Look at them.,3,5
Rickard Karstark, Tell your mother to look at them. She killed them as much as I.,3,5
Robb Stark, My mother had nothing to do with this. This was your treason.,3,5
Rickard Karstark," It's treason to free your enemies! In war, you kill your enemies! Did your father not teach you that, boy?!",3,5
Robb Stark, Leave him.,3,5
Rickard Karstark, Aye. Leave me to the king. He wants to give me a scolding before he sets me free. That's how he deals with treason. Our King in the North. Or should I call him the King Who Lost the North?,3,5
Robb Stark, Escort Lord Karstark to the dungeon. Hang the rest.,3,5
Karstark soldier," Mercy, sire! I didn't kill anyone, I only watched for the guards.",3,5
Robb Stark, This one was only the watcher. Hang him last so he can watch the others die.,3,5
Karstark soldier," Please! Please don't, they made me do it! They made me! They made me...!",3,5
Edmure Tully, Word of this can't leave Riverrun. They were Tywin Lannister's nephews; the Lannisters pay their debts - they never stop talking about that.,3,5
Robb Stark, Would you make me a liar as well as a murderer?,3,5
Edmure Tully, It wouldn't be lying. We'll bury them and remain silent until the war is done.,3,5
Robb Stark," I'm not fighting for justice if I don't serve justice to murderers in my ranks, no matter how highborn! He has to die.",3,5
Catelyn Stark, The Karstarks are Northmen. They won't forgive the killing of their Lord.,3,5
Talisa Maegyr," Your mother's right. If you do this, the Karstarks will abandon you.",3,5
Robb Stark," You tended to their wounds, you brought them supper. Now they're dead.",3,5
Talisa Maegyr, And more boys will keep dying until this war is over! You need Karstark men to end it!,3,5
Catelyn Stark," Spare his life, keep him as a hostage.",3,5
Edmure Tully," A hostage. Tell the Karstarks that as long as they remain loyal, he will not be harmed.",3,5
Rickard Karstark," The blood of the First Men flows in my veins as much as yours, boy. I fought the Mad King for your father. I fought Joffrey for you. We are kin, Stark and Karstark.",3,5
Robb Stark," That didn't stop you from betraying me, and it won't save you now.",3,5
Rickard Karstark, I don't want it to save me. I want it to haunt you to the end of your days!,3,5
Robb Stark," Kneel, my Lord.",3,5
Robb Stark," Rickard Karstark, Lord of Karhold, here in sight of Gods and men, I sentence you to die. Would you speak a final word?",3,5
Rickard Karstark, Kill me and be cursed! You are no King of mine!,3,5
Talisa Maegyr, Come to bed.,3,5
Robb Stark," You were right. the Karstarks are gone. Almost half our forces. Tywin Lannister knows what he needs to do, to make us unravel. Nothing. Only wait.",3,5
Talisa Maegyr, Don't let him.,3,5
Robb Stark, What can I do? Attack King's Landing? There's nothing he'd like better. He'd crush us in a day.,3,5
Talisa Maegyr," You could ride North, take your lands back from the Greyjoys. Wait out the winter.",3,5
Robb Stark," Winter could last five years. Once my bannermen are home again, sitting by the fire, surrounded by their families, warm and safe, they'll never ride south again. When I gathered my Lords together, we had a purpose, a mission. Now, we're like a band of bickering children!",3,5
Talisa Maegyr, Give them a new purpose.,3,5
Robb Stark, What?,3,5
Talisa Maegyr, I don't know.,3,5
Jaime Lannister," If I faint, pull me out. I don't intend to be the first Lannister to die in a bathtub.",3,5
Brienne of Tarth, Why should I care how you die?,3,5
Jaime Lannister," You swore a solemn vow, remember? You're supposed to get me to King's Landing in one piece. [Nods to his severed hand] Not going so well, is it? No wonder Renly died with you guarding him. [Brienne stands up with contempt] That was unworthy. Forgive me. You protected me better than most.",3,5
Brienne of Tarth, Don't you mock me.,3,5
Jaime Lannister, I'm apologizing. I'm sick of fighting. Let's call a truce.,3,5
Brienne of Tarth, You need trust to have a truce.,3,5
Jaime Lannister," I trust you. [Brienne sits back down] There it is. There's the look. I've seen it for 17 years on face after face. You all despise me. Kingslayer, Oathbreaker, man without honor. You've heard of wildfire?",3,5
Brienne of Tarth, Of course.,3,5
Jaime Lannister," The Mad King was obsessed with it. He loved to watch people burn, the way their skin blackened and blistered and melted off their bones. He burned lords he didn't like. He burned Hands who disobeyed him. He burned anyone who was against him. Before long, half the country was against him. Aerys saw traitors everywhere. So he had his pyromancer place caches of wildfire all over the city. Beneath the Sept of Baelor and the slums of Flea Bottom. Under houses, stables, taverns. Even beneath the Red Keep itself. Finally, the day of reckoning came. Robert Baratheon marched on the capital after his victory at the Trident. But my father arrived first with the whole Lannister army at his back, promising to defend the city against the rebels. I knew my father better than that. He's never been one to pick the losing side. I told the Mad King as much. I urged him to surrender peacefully. But the king didn't listen to me. He didn't listen to Varys who tried to warn him. But he did listen to Grand Maester Pycelle, that grey, sunken cunt. ""You can trust the Lannisters,"" he said. ""The Lannisters have always been true friends of the crown."" So we opened the gates and my father sacked the city. Once again, I came to the king, begging him to surrender. He told me to... bring him my father's head. Then he... turned to his pyromancer. ""Burn them all,"" he said. ""Burn them in their homes. Burn them in their beds."" Tell me, if your precious Renly commanded you to kill your own father and stand by while thousands of men, women, and children burned alive, would you have done it? Would you have kept your oath then? [Brienne stares at him in stunned silence.] First, I killed the pyromancer. And then when the king turned to flee, I drove my sword into his back. ""Burn them all,"" he kept saying. ""Burn them all."" I don't think he expected to die. He, he meant to... burn with the rest of us and rise again, reborn as a dragon to turn his enemies to ash. I slit his throat to make sure that didn't happen. That's where Ned Stark found me.",3,5
Brienne of Tarth, If this is true... why didn't you tell anyone? Why didn't you tell Lord Stark?,3,5
Jaime Lannister," Stark? You think the honorable Ned Stark wanted to hear my side? He judged me guilty the moment he set eyes on me. By what right does the wolf judge the lion? By what right-- [collapses, Brienne supports him]",3,5
Brienne of Tarth, Help! Help! The Kingslayer!,3,5
Jaime Lannister, Jaime. My name is Jaime.,3,5
Tywin Lannister, You're late.,3,5
Tyrion Lannister, What's she doing here?,3,5
Tywin Lannister, Our business concerns her as well. Sit.,3,5
Tyrion Lannister," You'll be pleased to learn that after one conversation with Olenna Tyrell, I've saved the Crown hundreds of thousands on this wedding.",3,5
Tywin Lannister, Never mind that now. We have something important to discuss.,3,5
Tyrion Lannister," I'm Master of Coin, saving money is important. [To Cersei, who is smiling at him.] Stop that. You're making me uncomfortable.",3,5
Tywin Lannister, Your sister has learned that your new friends the Tyrells are plotting to marry Sansa Stark to Sir Loras.,3,5
Tyrion Lannister," Very well. She's a lovely girl. Missing some of Loras's favorite bits, but I'm sure they'll make do.",3,5
Tywin Lannister, Your jokes are not appreciated.,3,5
Tyrion Lannister," It wasn't my best, but..",3,5
Tywin Lannister," I bring them into the royal fold and this is how they repay me, by trying to steal the key to the North out from under me.",3,5
Tyrion Lannister, Sansa is the key to the North? I seem to remember she has an older brother.,3,5
Tywin Lannister, The Karstarks have marched home. The Young Wolf has lost half his army. His days are numbered. Theon Greyjoy murdered both his brothers. That makes Sansa Stark the heir to Winterfell. And I am not about to hand her over to the Tyrells.,3,5
Tyrion Lannister, The Tyrell army is helping us to win this war. Do you really think it's wise to refuse them?,3,5
Tywin Lannister, There's nothing to refuse. This is a plot. Plots are not public knowledge. And the Tyrells won't carry this one out until after Joffrey's wedding. We need to act first and kill this union in its crib.,3,5
Tyrion Lannister, And how do we do that?,3,5
Tywin Lannister, We find Sansa Stark a different husband.,3,5
Tyrion Lannister, Wonderful.,3,5
Cersei Lanniser," Yes, it is.",3,5
Tyrion Lannister, You can't mean it.,3,5
Tywin Lannister, I can and I do.,3,5
Tyrion Lannister," Joffrey has made this poor girl's life miserable since the day he took her father's head. Now she's finally free of him and you give her to me? That's cruel, even for you.",3,5
Tywin Lannister," Do you intend on mistreating her? The girl's happiness is not my concern, nor should it be yours.",3,5
Tyrion Lannister, She's a child!,3,5
Cersei Lannister," She's flowered, I assure you. She and I have discussed it at length.",3,5
Tywin Lannister," There, you see? You will wed her, bed her, and put a child in her. Surely you're capable of that.",3,5
Tyrion Lannister, And if I refuse?,3,5
Tywin Lannister, You wanted to be rewarded for your valor in battle. Sansa Stark is a finer reward than you could ever dare hope for. And it is past time you were wed.,3,5
Tyrion Lannister, I was wed! Or don't you remember?,3,5
Tywin Lannister, Only too well.,3,5
Cersei Lannister, You should be thanking the gods for this. This is more than you deserve.,3,5
Tywin Lannister, Tyrion will do as he's bid. As will you.,3,5
Cersei Lannister, What do you mean?,3,5
Tywin Lannister, You'll marry Ser Loras.,3,5
Cersee Lannister, I will not.,3,5
Tywin Lannister," The boy is heir to Highgarden. Tyrion will secure the North, you will secure the Reach.",3,5
Cersei Lannnister," No, I won't do it.",3,5
Tywin Lannister," Yes, you will. You're still fertile. You need to marry again and breed.",3,5
Cersei Lannister," I am Queen Regent, not some broodmare!",3,5
Tywin Lannister, YOU'RE MY DAUGHTER! You will do as I command and you will marry Loras Tyrell and put an end to the disgusting rumors about you once and for all.,3,5
Cersei Lannnister," Father, don't make me do it again, please.",3,5
Tywin Lannister, Not another word. My children. You've disgraced the Lannister name for far too long.,3,5
Roose Bolton, [as Brienne and Jaime dine with him] I see my men have finally found you something appropriate to wear.,3,6
Brienne of Tarth," Yes, most kind of the. You're a Stark bannerman, Lord Bolton. I'm acting on Lady Stark's orders to return Jaime Lannister to King's Landing.",3,6
Roose Bolton," When King Robb left Harrenhall, his mother was his prisoner. If she wasn't his mother, he'd have hanged her for treason. I should send you back to Robb Stark.",3,6
Jaime Lannister," You should. But instead, you're sitting here, watching me fail at dinner. Why might that be?",3,6
Roose Bolton, Wars cost money. Many people would pay a great deal for you.,3,6
Jaime Lannister," We both know who would pay the most. He'll make you pay the most, if he found out you'd captured me and sent me back up North for a summary execution.",3,6
Roose Bolton," You're right. Perhaps, the safest course is to kill you both and burn your bodies.",3,6
Jaime Lannister," It would be, if you honestly believe my father would never find out about it.",3,6
Roose Bolton, King Robb is keeping your father quite busy. He doesn't have time for anything else.,3,6
Jaime Lannister, He'll make time for you.,3,6
Roose Bolton," As soon as you're well enough to travel, I will allow you to go to King's Landing as restitution for the mistakes my soldiers made. And you will swear to tell your father the truth. That I had nothing to do with your maiming.",3,6
Jaime Lannister, Shall we drink on it?,3,6
Roose Bolton, I don't partake.,3,6
Jaime Lannister," You do understand how suspicious that is to ordinary people? Very well. My lady, may our journey continue without further incident.",3,6
Roose Bolton," Oh, she won't be going with you.",3,6
Brienne of Tarth, I am charged with bringing Ser Jaime to-,3,6
Roose Bolton, You are charged with abetting treason.,3,6
Jaime Lannister, I'm afraid I must insist...,3,6
Roose Bolton, You're in no place to insist on anything. I would've hoped you'd learned your lesson about overplaying your...position.,3,6
Olenna Tyrell, [about the prospect of Loras marrying Cersei] Impossible,3,6
Tywin Lannister, Why?,3,6
Olenna Tyrell," My grandson is the pride of Highgarden, the most desirable bachelor in the whole Seven Kingdoms! Your daughter...",3,6
Tywin Lannister," Is rich, the most beautiful woman in the whole Seven Kingdoms, and the mother of the king.",3,6
Olenna Tyrell, Old.,3,6
Tywin Lannister, Old?,3,6
Olenna Tyrell," Old. I'm something of an expert on the subject. Her change will be upon her before long. I'll spare you the details of what will happen then. You men may have a stomach for bloodshed and slaughter, but this is another matter entirely.",3,6
Tywin Lannister," Oh, the years punish us as well, I promise you that. My stomach remains quite strong, however. The only thing that might turn it are details of your grandson's... nocturnal activities. Do you deny them?",3,6
Olenna Tyrell," Oh, not at all! A sword-swallower, through and through.",3,6
Tywin Lannister," Well, a boy with his affliction should be grateful for the opportunity to marry the most beautiful woman in the Seven Kingdoms, and remove the stain from his name.",3,6
Olenna Tyrell," Did you grow up with boy cousins, Lord Tywin? Sons of your father's bannermen, squires, stableboys?",3,6
Tywin Lannister, Of course...,3,6
Olenna Tyrell, And you... never...,3,6
Tywin Lannister, No.,3,6
Olenna Tyrell, Not once? Not in any way?,3,6
Tywin Lannister, Never.,3,6
Olenna Tyrell," I congratulate you on your restraint! But, it's a natural enough thing, two boys having a go at each other beneath the sheets.",3,6
Tywin Lannister, Perhaps Highgarden has a high tolerance for unnatural behavior.,3,6
Olenna Tyrell," I wouldn't say that. True, we don't tie ourselves into knots over a discreet bit of buggery, but... brothers and sisters... where I come from, that stain would be very difficult to wash out.",3,6
Tywin Lannister, I will not breathe further life into a malicious lie by discussing it. ),3,6
Olenna Tyrell," Lie or not, you must admit that many people find it quite convincing. Convincing enough to put swords in their hands and send them off to kill Lannisters and Tyrells, thanks to our new affiliation.",3,6
Tywin Lannister," I don't care what people believe, and neither do you.",3,6
Olenna Tyrell," As an authority on myself, I must disagree!",3,6
Tywin Lannister," Now, if the rumors about my children were true, then Joffrey is no King at all and House Tyrell is throwing it's prize flower into the dirt.",3,6
Olenna Tyrell," And if Cersei is too old to give Loras children, we are throwing another ""prize flower"" into the dirt. It is a chance we simply cannot take!",3,6
Tywin Lannister," The uncertainty makes you uncomfortable? All right, I'll remove it for you. If you refuse to marry Loras to Cersei, I will name him to the Kingsguard. And, I'm sure you're familiar with the Kingsguard's vows. He will never marry, he will never have children, the Tyrell name will fade and Highgarden will go to the children of Joffrey and Margaery.",3,6
Olenna Tyrell, You would have your grandson protected by someone who disgusts you?,3,6
Tywin Lannister, I would have my grandson protected by a skilled warrior who takes his vows seriously. So shall I draw up the order or do you consent to this match?,3,6
Olenna Tyrell, It's a rare enough thing- a man who lives up to his reputation. [plucks the quill from Tywin's fingers and snaps it in half],3,6
Jon Snow, [about The Wall] Have you ever climbed it before?,3,6
Ygritte," No, but Tormund's done it half a hundred times. You're afraid.",3,6
Jon Snow, Aren't you?,3,6
Ygritte," Aye. Well, it's a long way up, and a long way down, but... I've waited my whole life to see the world from up there. [she pulls out a set of climbing spikes] Here, sit down, brought a pair for you. They're too big for you, but they're good.",3,6
Jon Snow, You kill someone for them?,3,6
Ygritte," Nah. I didn't kill him, but I bet his balls are still bruised. He wasn't good to me, the way you're good to me. And he didn't do that thing you do with your tongue.",3,6
Jon Snow," Hey, can we not talk about that here?",3,6
Ygritte," ""Can we not talk about that here? I'm Jon Snow. I've killed dead men and Qhorin Halfhand, but I'm scared of naked girls!""",3,6
Jon Snow, Did I seem scared the other day?,3,6
Ygritte," [laughs] Oh, you were tremblin' like a leaf.",3,6
Jon Snow, Only in the beginning.,3,6
Ygritte," Only in the beginning. You're a proper lover, Jon Snow. And, don't worry, your secret's safe with me.",3,6
Jon Snow, What secret?,3,6
Ygritte," D'you think I'm as dumb as all those girls in silk dresses you knew growing up? You're loyal, and you're brave...You didn't stop being a Crow, the day you walked into Mance Rayder's tent. But I'm your woman now, Jon Snow. You're goin' to be loyal to your woman. The Night's Watch don't care if you live or die. Mance Rayder don't care if I live or die. We're just soldiers in their armies, and there's plenty more to carry on if we go down. But it's you and me that matters. Me and you. Don't ever betray me.",3,6
Jon Snow, I won't.,3,6
Ygritte," Because, I'll cut your pretty cock right off and wear it 'round me neck.",3,6
Tormund Giantsbane," [walks up] Sink your metal deep and make sure it holds, before taking your next step. And, if you fall, don't scream. You don't want that to be the last thing she remembers, eh?",3,6
Ramsay Snow, Sorry. Were you sleeping?,3,6
Theon Greyjoy, Wa...,3,6
Ramsay Snow, Wa? Wa? Water! You want some water. [Ramsay grabs a cup of water] I wish I had some for you. [Ramsay pours the water on the ground in front of an anguished Theon.] So let's play a game. Which body part do you need the least?,3,6
Theon Greyjoy, Please...,3,6
Ramsay Snow, Please is not a body part.,3,6
Theon Greyjoy," I'll tell you everything, please...",3,6
Ramsay Snow," But you already told me everything, remember? Your daddy was mean to you. The Starks didn't appreciate you. One good bit, though: the Stark boys, they're still alive. Wouldn't that be a hunt to remember? You failed, but I'm a better hunter than you. Now, how about your little finger? You don't need that for much, do you? No? Good. Let's start with that. You've been wondering why you're here, haven't you? Where you are, who I am, why I'm doing this to you. So guess. If you guess right, I'll tell you. By the Old Gods and the New, I swear it. You win the game if you can figure out who I am and why I'm torturing you, and I win the game if you beg me to cut off your finger!",3,6
Ramsay Snow," But you already told me everything, remember? Your daddy was mean to you. The Starks didn't appreciate you. One good bit, though: the Stark boys, they're still alive.

Theon Greyjoy," If I win, you'll let me go?",3,6
Ramsay Snow," If you think this has a happy ending, you haven't been paying attention.",3,6
Theon Greyjoy, Please...,3,6
Ramsay Snow, [pulling out a knife] You say please again and you'll wish you hadn't. You first. Where are we?,3,6
Theon Greyjoy, The North.,3,6
Ramsay Snow, Too vague.,3,6
Theon Greyjoy, Deepwood Motte.,3,6
Ramsay Snow, Terrible guess!,3,6
Ramsay Snow, Now where?,3,6
Theon Greyjoy, Last Hearth.,3,6
Ramsay Snow, Do I look like a fucking Umber to you?,3,6
Theon Greyjoy," Aaaah, the Karhold!",3,6
Ramsay Snow, Karhold? How did you know that? Did you see any banners flying when we came in?,3,6
Theon Greyjoy," No, it was just a guess.",3,6
Ramsay Snow," Very good, Lord Theon. And who am I?",3,6
Theon Greyjoy, Torrhen Karstark.,3,6
Ramsay Snow, He's dead. Strangled by the Kingslayer.,3,6
Theon Greyjoy, He was your brother. Your father is Lord Rickard Karstark. [A defeated Ramsay sits back down] You swore to tell me if I-!,3,6
Ramsay Snow, You're right.,3,6
Theon Greyjoy, Lord Rickard Karstark is Robb Stark's bannerman. I betrayed Robb. That's why you're torturing me.,3,6
Ramsay Snow," Yes. You win. [pause] Of course you forgot to ask one question. You forgot to ask if I'm a liar! [he sticks his knife back into Theon's little finger, causing Theon to scream in agony] I'm afraid I am. [hebegins carving Theon's skin on his little finger] Everything I told you is a lie. [he begins to peel off Theon's little finger skin. Theon screams in absolute pain] This isn't happening to you for a reason. Well, one reason: I enjoy it.",3,6
Ramsay Snow," Yes. You win. [pause] Of course you forgot to ask one question. You forgot to ask if I'm a liar! [he sticks his knife back into Theon's little finger, causing Theon to scream in agony] I'm afraid I am. [hebegins carving Theon's skin on his little finger] Everything I told you is a lie. [he begins to peel off Theon's little finger skin. Theon screams in absolute pain] This isn't happening to you for a reason. Well, one reason: I enjoy it.",3,6
Theon Greyjoy," PLEASE CUT IT OFF, CUT IT OFF, CUT IT OFF, AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!",3,6
Ramsay Snow, I win.,3,6
Varys," [about the Iron Throne] A thousand blades. Taken from the hands of Aegon's fallen enemies, forged in the fiery breath of Balerion the Dread.",3,6
Petyr Baelish, There aren't a thousand blades. There aren't even two hundred. I've counted.,3,6
Varys, Heh. I'm sure you have. Ugly old thing.,3,6
Petyr Baelish, Yet it has a certain... appeal.,3,6
Varys, The Lysa Arryn of chairs. Shame that you had to settle for your second choice.,3,6
Petyr Baelish," Early days, my friend. It is flattering, really, you feeling such dread at the prospect of me getting what I want.",3,6
Varys," Thwarting you has never been my primary ambition, I promise you... although who doesn't like to see their friends fail now and then.",3,6
Petyr Baelish," You're so right. For instance, when I thwarted your plan to give Sansa Stark to the Tyrells... if, I'm going to be honest, I did feel an unmistakable sense of... enjoyment there. But your confidante, the one who fed you information about my plans, the one you swore to protect, you didn't bring her any enjoyment. And she didn't bring me any enjoyment. She was a bad investment on my part. Luckily, I have a friend who wanted to try something new. Something daring. And he was so grateful to me for providing this fresh experience.",3,6
Varys, I did what I did for the good of the realm.,3,6
Petyr Baelish," The realm. Do you know what the realm is? It's the thousand blades of Aegon's enemies, a story we agreed to tell each other over and over 'till we forget that it's a lie.",3,6
Varys, But what do we have left once we abandon the lie? Chaos. A gaping pit waiting to swallow us all.,3,6
Petyr Baelish," Chaos... isn't a pit. Chaos is a ladder. Many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again. The fall breaks them. And some, who are given the chance to climb, they refuse. They cling to the realm. Or the gods. Or love. Illusions. Only the ladder is real. The climb is all there is.",3,6
Ygritte, How far are we?,3,7
Jon Snow," 'Bout a week, I think.",3,7
Ygritte, You think? You don't know?,3,7
Jon Snow," When we went to Castle Black, we took the Kingsroad.",3,7
Ygritte," You and your roads. Is that how you lot do your fighting? You march down a road, banging drums and waving banners?",3,7
Jon Snow," Most of the time, yes.",3,7
Ygritte, How do the men holding the banners fight?,3,7
Jon Snow," They don't, really. It's a great honor to carry a house sigil.",3,7
Ygritte, And the drummers? Is that a great honor too?,3,7
Jon Snow," Usually, it's the young boys bangin' the drums.",3,7
Ygritte, What good are they?,3,7
Jon Snow, They help the men march.,3,7
Ygritte, How?,3,7
Jon Snow," Well, it's, it's the rhythm.",3,7
Ygritte," [laughing] What, you mean, right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot? What, you need help remembering that? When Mance gives the signal and we hit Castle Black, we won't be banging on drums to let 'em know we're coming.",3,7
Jon Snow," No. No, you're just gonna light the biggest fire the North has ever seen, to let them know you're coming.",3,7
Ygritte," You know nothing, Jon Snow.",3,7
Missandei," Now comes the noble Razdal mo Eraz of that ancient and honorable house, master of men and speaker to savages, to offer terms of peace. Noble lord, you are in the presence of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains, and Mother of Dragons.",3,7
Daenerys Targaryen, You may approach. Sit.,3,7
Missandei, Will the noble lord take refreshment? [Razdahl nods and takes an offered cup of wine],3,7
Razdal," Ancient and glorious is Yunkai. Our empire was old before dragons stirred in old Valyria. Many an army has broken against our walls. You shall find no easy conquest here, Khaleesi.",3,7
Daenerys Targaryen, Good. My Unsullied need practice. I was told to blood them early.,3,7
Razdal," If blood is your desire, blood shall flow. But why? 'Tis true you have committed savageries in Astapor. But the Yunkai are a forgiving and generous people. The Wise Masters of Yunkai have sent a gift for the silver queen. [slaves bring in two chests of gold] There is far more than this awaiting you on the deck of your ship.",3,7
Daenerys Targaryen, My ship?,3,7
Razdal," Yes, khaleesi. As I said, we are a generous people. You shall have as many ships as you require.",3,7
Daenerys Targaryen, And what do you ask in return?,3,7
Razdal, All we ask is that you make use of these ships. Sail them back to Westeros where you belong and leave us to conduct our affairs in peace.,3,7
Daenerys Targaryen, I have a gift for you as well. Your life.,3,7
Razdal, My life?,3,7
Daenerys Targaryen," And the lives of your Wise Masters. But I also want something in return. You will release every slave in Yunkai. Every man, woman, and child shall be given as much food, clothing, and property as they can carry as payment for their years of servitude. Reject this gift, and I shall show you no mercy.",3,7
Razdal," You are mad. We are not Astapor or Qarth. We are Yunkai and we have powerful friends. Friends who would take great pleasure in destroying you. Those who survive, we shall enslave once more. Perhaps we'll make a slave of you as well. [One of Daenerys' dragons screeches] You swore me safe conduct.",3,7
Daenerys Targaryen," I did, but my dragons made no promises. And you threatened their mother.",3,7
Razdal, [to his slaves] Take the gold.,3,7
Daenerys Targaryen," My gold. You gave it to me, remember? And I shall put it to good use. You'd be wise to do the same with my gift to you. Now get out. [Razdal leaves]",3,7
Barristan Selmy, The Yunkish are a proud people. They will not bend.,3,7
Daenerys Targaryen, And what happens to things that don't bend?,3,7
Osha," [about Jojen] What's he goin' on about? And how come he always gets to sit and chat, while we do all the work?",3,7
Hodor, Hodor.,3,7
Jojen Reed, That's where we are...,3,7
Osha, What are you tellin' him?,3,7
Bran Stark," It's all right, Osha.",3,7
Osha, It's not all right. You think I can't hear you every day? Filling his head with black magic? Talking about visions and three-eyed ravens and worse?,3,7
Meera Reed, Leave him alone.,3,7
Osha, He can speak for himself.,3,7
Jojen Reed, I don't fill his head with anything.,3,7
Osha, So what d'you talk about?,3,7
Jojen Reed," What's happening to him, and...what that means.",3,7
Osha," Go on, then. Tell us what it means.",3,7
Jojen Reed, It's not like that. I wish that I could tell him all the answers; it would be much easier.,3,7
Osha," I don't want you talking to him anymore, until we get to your brother at Castle Black.",3,7
Jojen Reed, We're not going to Castle Black.,3,7
Osha, What did you say?,3,7
Jojen Reed," I told you already. Jon Snow isn't there. Bran needs to find the Raven, beyond the Wall.",3,7
Osha," Oh, no. I'm not going back there! Your brother is at Castle Black. That's where we're going! Look at me.",3,7
Bran Stark," The raven's been coming to me, ever since I fell from that tower. He wants me to find him. I don't have my legs anymore! This is what I have, now.",3,7
Osha," You have a family. You need to go back to Castle Black, so you can get back to them, where you belong.",3,7
Bran Stark, What if I belong in the North? What if...I fell from that tower for a reason?,3,7
Osha," [glares at Jojen] Is that what he's telling you? That it's all for a reason? All these bad things happened, because the Gods got big plans for you? I wish it were true, little Lord, but the Gods wouldn't spare a raven's cold shit for you, or me, or anyone.",3,7
Bran Stark, You don't understand. You don't know.,3,7
Osha," You don't know! None of you know. None of you have been up there! I had a man, once; a good man. Bruni, his name was. I was his, and he was mine. But one night, Bruni disappears. People said he left me, but I knew him. He'd never leave me. Not for long. I knew he'd come back. And he did. He came in through the back of the hut. Only, he wasn't Bruni, not really. His skin was... pale, like a dead man's. His eyes, bluer than clear sky. He came at me, grabbed me by the neck, and squeezed so hard I could feel the life slipping out of me. I don't know how I got the knife, but when I did, I stuck it deep into his heart. And he hardly seemed to notice. I had to burn our hut down, with him inside. I didn't ask the Gods what it meant. I didn't need to. It meant the North was no place for men to be, not anymore. I promised your Maester I'd get you to Castle Black, and no further.",3,7
Tywin Lannister, Your Grace.,3,7
Joffrey Baratheon, Grandfather.,3,7
Tywin Lannister, You wanted to speak to me?,3,7
Joffrey Baratheon, Yes! I'd like a report on the meetings of my Small Council.,3,7
Tywin Lannister," You're welcome to attend the meetings of your Small Council, Your Grace, any or all of them.",3,7
Joffrey Baratheon," I've been very busy, many important matters require a King's attention!",3,7
Tywin Lannister, Of course.,3,7
Joffrey Baratheon," You've been holding the Small Council meetings in the Tower of the Hand, instead of the Small Council Chamber.",3,7
Tywin Lannister," I have, yes.",3,7
Joffrey Baratheon, May I ask why?,3,7
Tywin Lannister, The Tower of the Hand is where I work. To walk from there to here would take time - time I could otherwise spend productively.,3,7
Joffrey Baratheon," So, if I wanted to attend one of my Small Council meetings, I would now have to climb all the stairs in the Tower of the Hand? [Tywin slowly walks up to the Iron Throne, unsettling Joffrey]",3,7
Tywin Lannister, ...We could arrange to have you carried.,3,7
Joffrey Baratheon," Tell me about the Targaryen girl in the East, and her dragons.",3,7
Tywin Lannister, Where did you hear about this?,3,7
Joffrey Baratheon, Is it true?,3,7
Tywin Lannister, Apparently so.,3,7
Joffrey Baratheon, Don't you think we ought to do something about it?,3,7
Tywin Lannister," When I was Hand of the King under your father's predecessor, the skulls of all the Targaryen dragons were kept in this room - and the skull of the last of them was right here. It was the size of an apple.",3,7
Joffrey Baratheon, And the biggest was the size of a carriage!,3,7
Tywin Lannister, Yes and the creature to whom it belonged died three hundred years ago! Curiosities on the far side of the world are no threat to us.,3,7
Joffrey Baratheon," But how do we know these dragons are...curiosities, and not the beasts that brought the whole world to heel?",3,7
Tywin Lannister," Because we have been told as much by the many experts who serve the Realm, by counseling the King, on matters about which he knows nothing.",3,7
Joffrey Baratheon, But I haven't been counseled!,3,7
Tywin Lannister, You are being counseled at this very moment.,3,7
Joffrey Baratheon, I should be consulted about such things.,3,7
Tywin Lannister," From now on, I will see to it that you are appropriately consulted on important matters...whenever necessary. [starts to walk away, then turns back and bows his head] Your Grace.",3,7
Locke," [watching Brienne in a gladiator pit, facing a bear] Well, this is one shameful fucking performance. Stop running and fight! :[Jaime appears, followed by Qyburn and a Bolton bodyguard, Steelshanks]",3,7
Locke," [watching Brienne in a gladiator pit, facing a bear] Well, this is one shameful fucking performance. Stop running and fight! :[Jaime appears, followed by Qyburn and a Bolton bodyguard, Steelshanks]",3,7
Jaime Lannister, A wooden sword?,3,7
Locke, Thought you'd gone.,3,7
Jaime Lannister, You gave her a wooden sword!,3,7
Locke, I've only got one bear.,3,7
Jaime Lannister," I'll pay her bloody ransom. Gold, sapphires, whatever you want. Just get her out of there!",3,7
Locke," All you Lords and Ladies. You still think that the only thing that matters is gold. [grabs the stump of Jaime's wrist] Well, this makes me happier than all your gold ever could. And that [points at Brienne's predicament] makes me happier than all her sapphires. So go buy yourself a golden hand and fuck yourself with it!",3,7
Jaime Lannister, Get behind me.,3,7
Brienne of Tarth, I will not.,3,7
Locke, The'FUCK you doin' to my bear?,3,7
Steelshanks," Lord Bolton charged me with bringin' him back to King's Landing, alive! An' that's what I intend to do!",3,7
Jaime Lannister, Pull her up! [two of the Bolton men do so; the bear starts to advance on Jaime],3,7
Brienne of Tarth, Hold my legs! [Jaime manages to take Brienne's hand] Pull me back! [the Bolton bannermen pull them both up],3,7
Locke, The bitch stays.,3,7
Jaime Lannister," I'm taking her to King's Landing, unless you kill me.",3,7
Locke, She belongs to me. Lord Bolton's orders.,3,7
Jaime Lannister," What do you think is more important to Lord Bolton? Getting his pet rat a reward or ensuring that Tywin Lannister gets his son back alive? Well, we must be on our way. Sorry about the sapphires.",3,7
Barristan Selmy," Your Grace, allow me to present the Captains of the Second Sons: Mero of Braavos, Prendahl Na Ghezn, and...",3,8
Barristan Selmy," Your Grace, allow me to present the Captains of the Second Sons: Mero of Braavos, Prendahl Na Ghezn, and...",3,8
Daario Naharis, Daario Naharis.,3,8
Mero," You're the mother of Dragons? I swear I fucked you once, in a pleasure house in Lys.",3,8
Jorah Mormont, Mind your tongue.,3,8
Mero," Why? I didn't mind hers. She licked my ass like she was born to do it. [grins at her, then gestures to Missandei] You, slave girl. Bring wine.",3,8
Daenerys Targaryen, We have no slaves here.,3,8
Mero," You'll all be slaves after the battle, unless I save you. Take your clothes off, and come and sit on Mero's lap, and I may give you my Second Sons.",3,8
Daenerys Targaryen," Give me your Second Sons, and I may not have you gelded. Ser Barristan, how many men fight for the Second Sons?",3,8
Barristan Selmy," Under two thousand, Your Grace.",3,8
Daenerys Targaryen," We have more, don't we?",3,8
Barristan Selmy, Ten thousand Unsullied.,3,8
Daenerys Targaryen," I'm only a young girl, new to the ways of war, but perhaps a seasoned Captain like yourself can explain to me how you propose to defeat us?",3,8
Daario Naharis, I hope the old man is better with a sword than he is with a lie. You have eight thousand Unsullied.,3,8
Daenerys Targaryen," You're very young, to be a Captain.",3,8
Prendahl Na Ghezn, He isn't a Captain; he's a lieutenant.,3,8
Daenerys Targaryen," Even if your numbers are right, you must admit the odds don't favor your side.",3,8
Mero, The Second Sons have faced worse odds and won.,3,8
Jorah Mormont, The Second Sons have faced worse odds and run.,3,8
Daenerys Targaryen," Or, you could fight for me.",3,8
Mero, We've taken the slavers' gold. We fight for Yunkai.,3,8
Daenerys Targaryen," I would pay you as much, and more.",3,8
Prendahl Na Ghezn," Our contract is our bond. If we break our bond, no one will hire the Second Sons again.",3,8
Daenerys Targaryen," Ride with me, and you'll never need another contract. You'll have gold and castles and lordships of your choosing, when I take back the Seven Kingdoms.",3,8
Daario Naharis," You have no ships, you have no siege weapons. You have no cavalry.",3,8
Daenerys Targaryen," A fortnight ago, I had no army. A year ago, I had no dragons. You have two days to decide.",3,8
Merot, Show me your cunt. I want to see if it's worth fighting for.,3,8
Grey Worm," [in Valyrian] My Queen, shall I slice out his tongue for you?",3,8
Daenerys Targaryen," [smiles, replies in Valyrian] These men are our guests. [to Mero] You seem to be enjoying my wine. Perhaps you'd like a flagon to help you think it over?",3,8
Mero, Only a flagon? And what are my brothers-in-arms to drink?,3,8
Daenerys Targaryen," A barrel, then?",3,8
Mero," Good! The Titan's Bastard does not drink alone. In the Second Sons, we share everything. Maybe after the battle, we'll all share you. I'll come looking for you after this is over.",3,8
Daenerys Targaryen," Ser Barristan, if it comes to battle, kill that one first.",3,8
Barristan Selmy," Gladly, Your Grace.",3,8
Joffrey Baratheon," Congratulations, my lady.",3,8
Sansa Stark," Thank you, your Grace.",3,8
Joffrey Baratheon," We've done it. You've married a Lannister! Soon you will have a Lannister baby. It's a dream come true for you, isn't it? What a glorious day!",3,8
Sansa Stark," Yes, your grace.",3,8
Joffrey Baratheon," I suppose it doesn't really matter which Lannister puts the baby into you. Maybe I'll pay you a visit after my uncle passes out. How'd you like that? [Sansa doesn't answer] You wouldn't? Well, that's all right. Ser Meryn and Ser Boris will hold you down. [to the crowd] Time for the bedding ceremony!",3,8
Tyrion Lannister, There will be no bedding ceremony.,3,8
Joffrey Baratheon," Where's your respect for tradition, uncle? Come, everyone! Pick her up, and carry her to her wedding bed. Get rid of her gown, she won't be needing it any longer. Ladies! Attend to my uncle, he's not heavy!",3,8
Tyrion Lannister, There will be no bedding ceremony.,3,8
Joffrey Baratheon, There will be if I command it!,3,8
Tyrion Lannister, Then you'll be fucking your own bride with a wooden cock!,3,8
Joffrey Baratheon, What did you say? What...did you...SAY?!,3,8
Tywin Lannister," I believe we can dispense with the bedding ceremony, Your Grace. I'm sure Tyrion did not mean to threaten the king.",3,8
Tyrion Lannister," [laughs] A bad joke, Your Grace. Made out of envy of your own royal manhood. Mine is so small, my poor wife won't even know I'm there.",3,8
Tywin Lannister," Your uncle is clearly quite drunk, Your Grace.",3,8
Tyrion Lannister," I am...guilty. But... But, it is my wedding night. My tiny drunk cock and I have a job to do. Come, wife. I vomited on a girl once. Middle of the act. Not proud of it. But I think honesty is important between a man and wife. Don't you agree? Come, I'll tell you all about it, put you in the mood.",3,8
Sansa Stark," Is that wise, my Lord?",3,8
Tyrion Lannister," Tyrion, Sansa. My name is Tyrion. [pours himself a cup of wine]",3,8
Sansa Stark," Is that wise, Tyrion?",3,8
Tyrion Lannister, Nothing was ever wiser. Astoundingly long...,3,8
Sansa Stark, What?,3,8
Tyrion Lannister," Neck. You have one. How old are you, exactly?",3,8
Sansa Stark, Fourteen.,3,8
Tyrion Lannister," Well, talk won't make you any older. My lord father has commanded me to consummate this marriage.",3,8
Tyrion Lannister," [shakes his head] Stop. I can't... I could, but I won't.",3,8
Sansa Stark," But, your father...",3,8
Tyrion Lannister," If my father wants someone to get fucked, I know where he can start. I won't share your bed. Not until you want me to.",3,8
Sansa Stark, What if I never want you to?,3,8
Tyrion Lannister," ""And so my Watch begins.""",3,8
Davos Seaworth, [in a cell] Your Grace!,3,8
Stannis Baratheon, They feeding you enough?,3,8
Davos Seaworth," Two meals a day: cold for breakfast, hot for supper. I cannot complain.",3,8
Davos Seaworth," Two meals a day: cold for breakfast, hot for supper. I cannot complain.",3,8
Stannis Baratheon, You don't belong in a place like this.,3,8
Davos Seaworth," Well, sad to say, but I've seen worse.",3,8
Stannis Baratheon," I'm sorry about your son. I never got the chance to tell you before. Good lad, loyal lad. Melisandre's returned.",3,8
Davos Seaworth, I didn't know she'd been gone.,3,8
Stannis Baratheon," Came back with a bastard boy, Robert's bastard boy.",3,8
Davos Seaworth, Why?,3,8
Stannis Baratheon," She says ""power in king's blood.""",3,8
Davos Seaworth, She's going to kill him.,3,8
Stannis Baratheon, Sacrifice him.,3,8
Davos Seaworth," Forgive me, Your Grace, I'm not a learned man, but is there a difference between kill and sacrifice? The boy's your nephew.",3,8
Stannis Baratheon, What of it? We're at war. Why should I spare the son of some tavern slut Robert bedded one drunken night?,3,8
Davos Seaworth, Because he has your blood in his veins.,3,8
Stannis Baratheon, So did Renly.,3,8
Davos Seaworth," Renly wronged you. Renly declared himself king when the throne belonged to you. He raised an army, stole your bannermen. This boy's done you no harm. He's an innocent.",3,8
Stannis Baratheon," How many boys live in Westeros? How many girls? How many men? How many women? ""The darkness will devour them all"", she says, ""the night that never ends."" Unless I triumph. I never asked for this - no more than I asked to be King. We do not choose our destiny, but we must do our duty, no? Great or small, we must do our duty. What's one bastard boy against a kingdom?",3,8
Davos Seaworth," Your Grace, why did you come to see me, today?",3,8
Stannis Baratheon, I came to free you. If you swear to never raise your hand to the Lady Melisandre again.,3,8
Davos Seaworth, I swear it. I can't swear never to speak against her.,3,8
Stannis Baratheon, You have little regard for your own life.,3,8
Davos Seaworth," Quite little, Your Grace. Verging on none. You could've freed me yesterday, or tomorrow... but you came to me now, before this boy is put to the knife, because... you knew I'd counsel restraint. You came to hear me say it, because you believe it yourself. You're not a man who slaughters innocents, for gain or glory. When my son was five, he said to me, ""I don't ever want to die."" I wanted to say to him, ""You won't child- you won't ever."" I hated the idea of him lying awake in the dark, afraid. I think mothers and fathers made up the Gods... because they wanted their children to sleep through the night.",3,8
Stannis Baratheon," I saw a vision in the flames. A great battle in the snow... I saw it. And you saw whatever she gave birth to. I never believed, but when you see the truth, when it's right there in front of you, as real as these iron bars... how can you deny her God is real?",3,8
Margaery Tyrell," You look radiant, your Grace.",3,8
Cersei Lannister, Radiant? Why radiant?,3,8
Margaery Tyrell," It's word that came to mind. We're going to be sisters soon, we should be friends.",3,8
Cersei Lannister," You're a musical girl, aren't you? I imagine you have a lovely voice.",3,8
Margaery Tyrell," A better dancer, than a singer, I'm afraid.",3,8
Cersei Lannister," Ah, but you know the song, the Rains of Castamere?",3,8
Margaery Tyrell, Of course. They play it so often here at court.,3,8
Cersei Lannister, So you know the story of House Reyne of Castamere?,3,8
Margaery Tyrell," Not as well as you, I'm sure.",3,8
Cersei Lannister," House Reyne was a powerful family. Very wealthy. Second wealthiest in Westeros. Aren't the Tyrells the second wealthiest family in Westeros now? Of course, ambitious climbers don't want to stop on the second highest rung. If only you could take that final step. You'd see further than all the rest. You'd be alone with nothing but blue sky above you. So Lord Reyne built a castle, as grand as Casterly Rock. He gave his wife diamonds, larger than any my mother ever wore. And finally, one day, he rebelled against my father. Do you know where House Reyne is now?",3,8
Margaery Tyrell, Gone?,3,8
Cersei Lannister," Gone? A gentle word. Why not say slaughtered? Every man, woman and child, put to the sword. I remember seeing their bodies hanging high above the gates of Casterly Rock. My father let them rot up there all summer. It was a long summer. [Quoting ""Rains of Castamere] And now the rains weep o'er their halls, and not a soul to hear."" If you ever call me ""sister"" again, I'll have you strangled in your sleep.",3,8
CATELYN, Are you sure about this?,3,9
ROBB, No.,3,9
CATELYN, It's dangerous.,3,9
ROBB," If we take Tywin's castle from him, the lords of Westeros will realize he's not invincible. Take his home, take his gold, take his power.",3,9
CATELYN, Why are you telling me?,3,9
ROBB, You begged me not to send Theon to negotiate with his father and I ignored your advice.,3,9
ROBB, Now Winterfell is burned to the ground. The North is overrun with Ironborn and Bran and Rickon are gone.,3,9
ROBB," So, Casterly Rock? I'm asking your advice.",3,9
CATELYN, We have enough men?,3,9
ROBB, If Walder Frey cooperates.,3,9
CATELYN, If Walder Frey cooperates.,3,9
CATELYN," If reinforcements arrive from King's Landing, before we take the castle, we'll be caught between Tywin's army and the sea.",3,9
ROBB, We'll lose the war and die the way father died. Or worse.,3,9
CATELYN, Show them how it feels to lose what they love.,3,9
WALDER," My honored guests, be welcome within my walls and at my table. I extend to you my hospitality and protection in the light of the Seven.",3,9
ROBB," We thank you for your hospitality, my lord.",3,9
ROBB," I have come to make my apologies, my lord, and to beg your forgiveness.",3,9
WALDER," Don't beg my forgiveness, your Grace. It wasn't me you spurned, it was my girls.",3,9
WALDER," One of them was supposed to be queen, now none of them are.",3,9
WALDER," This is Arwyn, my daughter. My daughter Walda, my daughter Derwa, my daughter Waldra.",3,9
WALDER, My eldest granddaughters Ginia and Neila.,3,9
WALDER," Serra and Sarra, granddaughters, twins. You could have had either. Could have had both for all I care.",3,9
WALDER, My granddaughter Marianne. My granddaughter Freya. My granddaughter...W-W-Wertha? Waldra? Waldina?,3,9
MERRY, I'm Merry.,3,9
WALDER," Fine. And here's my youngest daughter Shirei, though she hasn't bled yet. Clearly you don't have the patience for all that.",3,9
ROBB," My ladies. All men should keep their word, kings most of all. I was pledged to marry one of you and I broke that vow. The fault is not with you. Any man would be lucky to have any one of you. I did what I did not to slight you, but because I loved another. I know these words cannot set right the wrong I have done to you and your house. I beg your forgiveness and pledge to do all I can to make amends so the Freys of the Crossing and the Starks of Winterfell may once again be friends.",3,9
WALDER, Very good.,3,9
WALDER," There she is. Come closer, let me have a look at you.",3,9
WALDER, Still can't see you. Old eyes.,3,9
WALDER," Love. That's what the Starks of Winterfell call it, eh? Heh. Very honorable, I call it a pretty face. Mmmm, very pretty. Prettier than this lot, that's for sure. Very shapely as well. Oh, you try to hide her under that dress. If you wanted to hide her, you shouldn't have brought her here in the first place.",3,9
WALDER," I can always see what's going on beneath a dress. Been at this a long time. I bet when you take that dress off, everything stays right where it is. Doesn't drop an inch.",3,9
WALDER, Your king says he betrayed me for love. I say he betrayed me for firm tits and a tight fit.,3,9
WALDER," And I can respect that. When I was your age, I'd have broken fifty oaths to get into that without a second thought. Well, I've enough room in the hall for you lot. We'll set up tents outside with food and ale for the rest of your men.",3,9
ROBB," Thank you, my lord.",3,9
WALDER," Well, let's get ready. The wine will flow red and the music will play loud and we'll put this mess behind us.",3,9
[Scene changes to the desert outside of the city of Yunkai on the continent of Essos. An army of Unsullied are standing guard outside of DAENERYS TARGARYEN'S tent. Inside her tent are her closest advisers," DAARIO NAHARIS, BARRISTAN SELMY, JORAH MORMONT and GREY WORM. They are looking at a map of Yunkai]",3,9
DAENERYS, Where?,3,9
DAARIO, There.,3,9
DAARIO," There, it's a back gate. My men use it when they visit Yunkai's bed slaves.",3,9
JORAH, Your men but not you?,3,9
DAARIO, I have no interest in slaves. A man cannot make love to property.,3,9
DAARIO," This is where we enter the city. Very few guards, they know me. They let me inside.",3,9
BARRISTAN, We're not gonna sneak an army through a back gate.,3,9
DAARIO," I kill the guards. I take your two best men and lead them through the back streets, which I know well, and open the front gates.",3,9
DAARIO," Then comes the army. Once the walls are breached, the city will fall in hours.",3,9
JORAH," Or perhaps you'll lead Grey Worm and me to the slaughter, cutting the head off our army. The masters of Yunkai will pay you your fee and you won't have to split it three ways cause you've already slaughtered your partners.",3,9
DAARIO," You have a very suspicious mind. In my experience, only dishonest people think this way.",3,9
JORAH, You command the Unsullied. What do you think?,3,9
DAENERYS," [Speaking to Grey Worm in Valyrian] Lo jention mirre numazme eza, iderenna qopsa verdagon issa.",3,9
GREY WORM, [In Valyrian] I trust him.,3,9
DAENERYS," [Speaking in the Common Tongue (in this case, English) again] You leave tonight.",3,9
JORAH, Very good. We'll prepare.,3,9
BARRISTAN, Ser Jorah. You can use an extra sword.,3,9
JORAH," You're the Queensguard, Ser Barristan. Your place is by the Queen. If we are truly her loyal servants, we'll do whatever needs to be done. No matter the cost, no matter our pride.",3,9
SAMWELL," We're west of Castle Black, but the Nightfort's closest to us. It was the first castle on the Wall. The Watch abandoned it during the reign of King Jaehaerys I. Too big, impossible to maintain. Other than Castle Black itself, the Nightfort's the perfect castle for us. It's got a secret sally port, the Black Gate, as old as the Wall itself. No one's used it for centuries, most likely. It leads through the Wall right down into the Nightfort, if no one knows how to find it, which, it just so happens I do.",3,9
GILLY, How do you know all that?,3,9
SAMWELL, I read about it in a very old book.,3,9
GILLY, You know all that from staring at marks on paper?,3,9
SAMWELL, Yes.,3,9
GILLY, You're like a wizard.,3,9
GILLY, Our father used to tell us that no wildling ever looked upon the Wall and lived. Here we are. Alive.,3,9
THE HOUND, Remember what happens to children who run. I'm your father and I'll do the talking.,3,9
PIG FARMER," The roads have gone right to hell, haven't they? Cracked three spokes this morning.",3,9
THE HOUND, Need a hand?,3,9
PIG FARMER, Need about eight hands.,3,9
PIG FARMER, Got to get this salt pork to The Twins in time for the wedding.,3,9
PIG FARMER, Many thanks.,3,9
ARYA, Don't! Don't kill him.,3,9
THE HOUND, Dead rats don't squeak.,3,9
ARYA," You're so dangerous, aren't you? Saying scary things to little girls. Killing little boys and old people. A real hard man you are.",3,9
THE HOUND, More than anyone you know.,3,9
ARYA, You're wrong. I know a killer. A real killer.,3,9
THE HOUND, That so?,3,9
ARYA, You'd be like a kitten to him. He'd kill you with his little finger.,3,9
THE HOUND, That him?,3,9
ARYA, No.,3,9
THE HOUND, Good.,3,9
ARYA, Don't kill him! Please. Please don't.,3,9
THE HOUND, You're very kind. Someday it'll get you killed.,3,9
OSHA, Where are we?,3,9
BRAN," The Gift, I think. Brandon The Builder gave all this land south of the Wall to the Night’s Watch for their sustenance and support. Maester Luwin taught me that.",3,9
JOJEN, Doesn’t seem to be supporting anyone at the moment.,3,9
MEERA, It’s good land and there’s no war up here. Why leave?,3,9
BRAN, Wildlings.,3,9
BRAN," Sorry. But they come over the Wall and raid, steal, carry off women.",3,9
RICKON, Old Nan said they turn your skull into a cup and make you drink your own blood from it.,3,9
RICKON, That’s what Old Nan said.,3,9
JOJEN, There’s a storm coming.,3,9
BRAN, I don’t see any.,3,9
MEERA, It’s as good a place to shelter as any.,3,9
OSHA, We can drink some blood while we wait. I don’t need much.,3,9
ORELL, Only one old man and eight good horses.,3,9
TORMUND, What’s one old man doing with eight horses?,3,9
JON, He breeds them for the Watch.,3,9
YGRITTE, How’s he keep folks from stealing them?,3,9
JON, The Watch protects him.,3,9
ORELL," Not today they don’t. He’s selling horses, he’s got some gold in there.",3,9
TORMUND, And proper steel.,3,9
ORELL, Let’s carve him up.,3,9
JON, We just take the horses and go. The old man’s no threat.,3,9
ORELL, I keep telling you.,3,9
YGRITTE, He’s an old man. A spear through the heart’s a better way to die than coughing up your last with no one but your horses to hear.,3,9
JON, The Watch might send a few men looking for a horse thief. They’ll send a lot more to hunt down murderers.,3,9
TORMUND," I hope so. Killing crows in their castle is tough. Killing them out here in the open, that’s what we do.",3,9
TORMUND, Spread out. Surround the hut and move in.,3,9
JON, Ygritte!,3,9
TORMUND, Clear the barn!,3,9
ARYA, No one’s going to believe you’re a hog farmer if you eat them all.,3,9
THE HOUND, Best part of the animal.,3,9
THE HOUND," Don’t worry, they’re still there.",3,9
ARYA, I know they’re still there.,3,9
THE HOUND, You check every five minutes like you’re afraid they’re gonna move.,3,9
ARYA, I’m not afraid.,3,9
THE HOUND," Of course you are. You’re almost there and you’re afraid you won’t make it. The closer you get, the worse the fear gets. No point in trying to hide behind that face. I know fear when I see it. Seen it a lot.",3,9
ARYA, I knew fear when I saw it in you. You’re afraid of fire.,3,9
ARYA," When Beric’s sword went up in flames, you looked like a scared little girl.",3,9
ARYA," And I know why, too. I heard what your brother did to you. Pressed your face to the fire like you’re a nice juicy mutton chop.",3,9
THE HOUND, That give you some ideas?,3,9
ARYA, Might do.,3,9
THE HOUND, Go ahead then. You might get away. Might even make it there on your own. They’re just over the river. The closest you’ve been to family since Ilyn Payne snipped your daddy’s neck.,3,9
ARYA, Someday I’m gonna put a sword through your eye and out the back of your skull.,3,9
BRAN, How are we going to get past the Wall? My uncle said it’s 700 feet high.,3,9
BRAN, How did you get past it?,3,9
OSHA, Got in a boat and rowed past the Bay of Seals.,3,9
BRAN, It would take us two months to get to the Bay of Seals.,3,9
OSHA, Some climb straight up the ice.,3,9
BRAN, Even Hodor’s not strong enough to climb the Wall with me on his back.,3,9
HODOR, Hodor!,3,9
JOJEN, Nineteen castles guard the Wall. Only three are still manned.,3,9
Hodor, Hodor!,3,9
JOJEN, One of those abandoned fortresses will give us a way through.,3,9
BRAN, My uncle said the gates were sealed with ice and stone when the castles were deserted.,3,9
MEERA," Well, we’ll have to open them up again.",3,9
OLD MAN," [From outside] Whoa, whoa, whoa!",3,9
MEERA, There’s a rider out there.,3,9
JOJEN, Just one?,3,9
MEERA, There’s more.,3,9
HODOR, Hodor!,3,9
OSHA," It’s just thunder, sweet giant.",3,9
HODOR, Hodor.,3,9
OLD MAN, [From outside] I yield. I yield.,3,9
JOJEN, Wildlings.,3,9
OSHA, [To BRAN and RICKON] Where’s Shaggydog and Summer?,3,9
BRAN, Hunting.,3,9
HODOR, Hodor!,3,9
JOJEN," Shhh, quiet, Hodor.",3,9
HODOR, Hodor!,3,9
JOJEN, [To BRAN] Make him shut up. If they hear us…,3,9
BRAN," [To Hodor] Hush, Hodor. No, no more Hodoring.",3,9
HODOR, Hodor!,3,9
BRAN," Hodor, calm down.",3,9
OSHA, You need to keep quiet.,3,9
JOJEN, They’re gonna hear us.,3,9
BRAN," Hodor, be quiet.",3,9
BRAN," Hodor, calm down. Hodor, be quiet!",3,9
MEERA, [To BRAN] What did you do?,3,9
Bran, Nothing. I don’t know.,3,9
RICKON, What’s That?,3,9
OSHA, That’s a horse dying.,3,9
WILDLING 1, Bring them over here.,3,9
WILDLING 2, That was the last of them. The rest are dead.,3,9
ORELL, [To TORMUND] I heard shouting up there.,3,9
TORMUND, Thunder.,3,9
ORELL, I know the difference between shouting and thunder.,3,9
TORMUND, Maybe it's ghosts.,3,9
TORMUND," That won’t help you, grandpa.",3,9
TORMUND, Where you riding?,3,9
OLD MAN," Doesn’t matter now, does it?",3,9
TORMUND," No, it doesn’t matter now.",3,9
ORELL, Cut his throat or he’ll tell the crows we’re here.,3,9
TORMUND, You understand.,3,9
OLD MAN, Let me stand at least.,3,9
OLD MAN, Let me go with a bit of dignity.,3,9
Orell, [Looks at JON] Make the crow kill him. [Walks towards JON] You’re one of us now. Prove it.,3,9
Jojen, [Looks at BRAN] The wolves are out there.,3,9
BRAN, I can’t do it by choice. I don’t know how. It happens in my dreams.,3,9
JOJEN," You’re a warg, Bran. It’s in your blood.",3,9
BRAN, I can’t.,3,9
JOJEN," You just did, with him.",3,9
JOJEN, A wolf is nothing compared to that.,3,9
OLD MAN, She looks sharp.,3,9
YGRITTE, [Looks at Jon] Do it. Do it.,3,9
ORELL, Told ya. He’s still one of them.,3,9
TORMUND," Go on, boy.",3,9
TORMUND, Go on!,3,9
ORELL, He’s a crow. He’ll always be a crow. And here’s his crow wife guarding him. He’ll stab us in the back first chance he gets.,3,9
TORMUND, Kill him!,3,9
Tormund, He’s one of them!,3,9
YGRITTE, No!,3,9
TORMUND, Do you hear me?,3,9
TORMUND, You’re not gonna die for one of them.,3,9
JOJEN, Do it. They’ll find us if you don’t.,3,9
JON, You were right the whole time.,3,9
DAARIO," When you hear a songbird’s whistle, you come. I’m a great whistler, the greatest in the land.",3,9
DAARIO, Daario Naharis.,3,9
DAARIO, That one was quick.,3,9
JORAH, There may be others.,3,9
DAARIO, I doubt it. The Yunkish prefer to let their slaves do their fighting for them.,3,9
JORAH, [Addressing DAARIO] That’s what you call a few guards?,3,9
ROSLIN," Lord Edmure, I hope I’m not a disappointment to you.",3,9
EDMURE," You’re a delight to me, my lady.",3,9
SEPTON, You may now cloak the bride and bring her under your protection.,3,9
SEPTON," In the sight of the Seven, I hereby seal these two souls, binding them as one for eternity. Look upon each other and say the words.",3,9
EDMURE & ROSLIN," Father, Smith, Warrior, Mother, Maiden, Crone, Stranger. I am hers (I am his) and she is mine (he is mine) from this day until the end of my days.",3,9
MEERA, Is that safe?,3,9
OSHA, They’re long gone.,3,9
BRAN, [Looks at JOJEN] You were right. I can get inside Summer’s mind whenever I want.,3,9
JOJEN, Of course you can. North of the Wall there are wildlings who can control all sorts of animals. But you did a lot more than that. You got inside Hodor’s mind.,3,9
BRAN, They can’t do that north of the Wall?,3,9
JOJEN, No one can do that. Anywhere.,3,9
BRAN," [Looks at RICKON] When I was looking through Summer’s eyes, I saw Jon.",3,9
RICKON, Where?,3,9
BRAN, He was with the wildlings. They tried to kill him but he got away.,3,9
OSHA, He’ll be heading back to Castle Black then. That’s where we should go.,3,9
BRAN," For all we know, Castle Black’s already under attack. If this many wildlings got through-",3,9
OSHA, I already told you. I’m not going north of the Wall.,3,9
BRAN, Everything Jojen told me is true. You saw what I did to Hodor. I have to find the three-eyed raven.,3,9
OSHA," Listen to me, little lord.",3,9
BRAN," Don’t worry, I’m not asking you to come with me. It won’t be safe for Rickon.",3,9
RICKON, [Surprised] Me? I’m coming with you.,3,9
BRAN, No. You and Osha and Shaggydog head for the Last Hearth. The Umbers are our bannermen. They’ll protect you.,3,9
RICKON, I’m coming with you. I’m your brother. I have to protect you.,3,9
BRAN," Right now, I have to protect you.",3,9
BRAN," Robb’s at war and I’m going beyond the Wall. If something happens to us, you’re the heir to Winterfell.",3,9
BRAN, [Looks at OSHA] Will you know how to find the last Hearth?,3,9
OSHA, You Southerners build your big castles and you never move. You’re easy to find.,3,9
RICKON, We’re not Southerners.,3,9
RICKON, And I don’t want to leave you.,3,9
OSHA," Shhh. [She grabs RICKON by the waist and sits him on her lap] Come here, little soldier. You and me, we’re gonna have some adventures.",3,9
Bran, You don’t have to do any of this.,3,9
OSHA," Your family took me in and was good to me when they had no cause to be. [To RICKON] Shhh. We’ll be fine, you and me. The Umbers are great warriors. Even I heard about them growing up. They’ll teach you how to swing a sword.",3,9
RICKON," [Crying, looks at OSHA] I know how to swing a sword.",3,9
BRAN, You’re leaving now? It’s the middle of the night.,3,9
OSHA, I learned to walk in darkness.,3,9
OSHA," Say your good-byes, little man.",3,9
Osha, [Looks at the Reeds] Keep this one safe. [MEERA gives a slight nod] He means the world to me.,3,9
Daenerys," We’ve been waiting a long time. [BARRISTAN looks at her] Haven’t we? [BARRISTAN shrugs] Well I don’t know, you tell me. How long does it take to sack a city?",3,9
JORAH, [Looks at DAENERYS] It was just as you said. They did not believe until it was too late. Their slave soldiers threw down their spears and surrendered.,3,9
DAENERYS, And Daario Naharis?,3,9
DAARIO," The city is yours, my queen.",3,9
TALISA," [Looking at the band and talking to LOTHAR] They’re good, aren’t they?",3,9
LOTHAR, They ought to be because they cost enough.,3,9
BLACKFISH, Look at the crowd there.,3,9
CATELYN, [Looking at EDMURE and talking to BLACKFISH] He complained about this marriage the entire ride from Riverrun and now look at him.,3,9
BLACKFISH, The God’s love to reward a fool.,3,9
CATELYN, [Laughs] Uncle.,3,9
BLACKFISH," What? He’s my nephew, I love him. And he’s a damned fool.",3,9
CATELYN," Don’t you drink, Lord Bolton?",3,9
ROOSE," Never do, my lady. Dulls the senses.",3,9
BLACKFISH, That’s the point. [Still talking to ROOSE while the servant pours him more wine] Didn’t you marry one of these Frey girls?,3,9
ROOSE," Aye. Lord Walder let me choose any of his granddaughters and promised me the girl’s weight in silver as a dowry. So I have a fat, young bride.",3,9
CATELYN, I hope she makes you very happy.,3,9
ROOSE," Well, she’s made me very rich.",3,9
BLACKFISH," Pardon, my lord, my lady. I need to find a tree to piss on.",3,9
ROBB, My mother’s alone with Roose Bolton. I should rescue her.,3,9
TALISA, Your mother is less in need of rescue than any woman I’ve ever met.,3,9
ROBB, Be kind. She’s finally starting to like you.,3,9
TALISA," And I like her. But if she had her way, I would be back in Volantis, playing my harp and you would be sitting over there [Looks at EDMURE and ROSLIN], eating blackberries out of Roslin Frey’s hand.",3,9
ROBB, Perhaps I’ve made a terrible mistake.,3,9
ROBB, Striking your king is an act of treason.,3,9
TALISA," No, don’t. Don’t insult them.",3,9
WALDER, [Addressing ROBB loudly so everybody can hear] Your Grace.,3,9
WALDER," The Septon has prayed his prayers, some words were said and Lord Edmure has wrapped my daughter in a cloak. But they are not yet man and wife. A sword needs a sheath [Everybody laughs]. And a wedding needs a bedding [Everybody cheers]. What does my sire say?",3,9
EVERYBODY," [Knocking on the tables, chanting] To bed! To bed! To bed!",3,9
ROBB," [Gets up from his seat and addresses WALDER] If you think the time is right, Lord Walder, by all means, let us bed them.",3,9
EVERYBODY, [Chanting] To bed! To bed! To bed!,3,9
EDMURE," Ho-ho! Careful now, ladies. Once you set that monster free, there’s no caging him again [Laughs].",3,9
EVERYBODY, [Chanting] To bed! To bed! To bed!,3,9
CATELYN, Poor girl.,3,9
ROOSE, Every bride suffers the same. I’m sure you endured yours with grace.,3,9
CATELYN," Oh, Ned forbade it. He said it wouldn’t be right if he broke a man’s jaw on our wedding night.",3,9
TALISA, That is a very strange custom.,3,9
ROBB, I suppose it does seem strange from a foreigner’s perspective.,3,9
TALISA, It seems normal to you?,3,9
ROBB," It’s tradition. [TALISA stares at ROBB] Without the bedding ceremony, there’s no real proof the lord and lady consummated their marriage.",3,9
TALISA," No, but there are other ways of providing proof.",3,9
ROBB, Boy or girl?,3,9
TALISA," I don’t know. But if it’s a boy, I know what we should name him.",3,9
ROBB," Oh, do you? It seems to me the father should have some say in his son’s naming.",3,9
TALISA, Eddard. [Catches ROBB by surprise] Don’t you want to teach little Ned Stark how to ride horses?,3,9
ROBB, I do.,3,9
THE HOUND," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.",3,9
FREY GUARD, Where are you going?,3,9
THE HOUND, Got salt pork for the feast.,3,9
FREY GUARD, The feast is over.,3,9
THE HOUND, It doesn’t sound like it’s over.,3,9
FREY GUARD," If I tell you it’s over, it’s over. [Angrily] Turn this cart around and get the hell out of here.",3,9
THE HOUND," Got pig’s feet, too [ARYA looks up].",3,9
FREY GUARD, [Infuriated] Are you soft in the head? Turn this cart around!,3,9
WALDER, Your Grace.,3,9
WALDER, I feel I’ve been remiss in my duties.,3,9
WALDER, I’ve given you meat and wine and music but I haven’t shown you the hospitality you deserve. My king has married and I owe my new queen a wedding gift.,3,9
CATELYN, Robb!,3,9
MAN 1," [Laughing] You ready to head home to Winterfell, eh? [Men laughing]",3,9
MAN 2," Feast over yet, is it?",3,9
FREY MAN," Aye, it’s over! [Slit’s the throat of a Stark soldier]",3,9
THE HOUND, It’s too late.,3,9
WALDER," The King in the North arises, heh heh.",3,9
CATELYN," Lord Walder! Lord Walder, enough! Let it end! Please! He is my son! [ROBB is still cradling TALISA on the floor] My first son! Let him go and I swear that we will forget this! I swear it by the Old Gods and New! We will take no vengeance.",3,9
WALDER," [Angrily] You already swore me one oath right here in my castle. You swore by all the Gods, your son would marry my daughter!",3,9
CATELYN," Take me for a hostage but let Robb go! Robb, get up! Get up and walk out! Please! Please!",3,9
WALDER, And why I would let him do that?,3,9
CATELYN," On my honor as a Tully, on my honor as a Stark, let him go or I will cut your wife’s throat!",3,9
WALDER, I’ll find another.,3,9
ROBB, Mother.,3,9
ROOSE, The Lannisters send their regards.,3,9
Walder Frey," My honored guests, be welcome within my walls and at my table. I extend to you my hospitality and my protection in the light of the Seven.",3,10
Robb Stark," Thank you for your hospitality, my lord. I've come to make my apologies, my lord, and to beg your forgiveness.",3,10
Walder Frey," Don't beg my forgiveness, your grace. It wasn't me you spurned, it was my girls. One of them was supposed to be queen. Now none of them are. This is Arwaya, my daughter, my daughter Walda, my daughter Derwa, my daughter Waldra. My eldest granddaughters Janeya and Neyela. Serra and Sarra, granddaughters, twins. You could have had either. You could have both for all I care. My granddaughter Marianne, my granddaughter Freya, my granddaughter...Wertha? Walra? Waldina?",3,10
Merry Frey, I'm Merry.,3,10
Walder Frey," Fine. And here's my youngest daughter, Shirei. Though she hasn't bled yet, clearly you don't have the patience for all that.",3,10
Robb Stark," My ladies, all men should keep their word. Kings most of all. I was pledged to marry one of you and I broke that vow. The fault is not with you. Any man would be lucky to have any one of you. I did what I did not to slight you but because I loved another. I know these words cannot set right the wrong I've done to you and your house. I beg your forgiveness and pledge to do all I can to make amends so the Freys of the Crossing and the Starks of Winterfell may once again be friends.",3,10
Walder Frey, Very good.,3,10
Catelyn Stark," He complained about this marriage the entire way from Riverrun, and now look at him.",3,10
Brynden Tully, The Gods love to reward a fool.,3,10
Catelyn Stark, Uncle!,3,10
Brynden Tully," What? He's my nephew, I love him, and, he's a damn fool.",3,10
Catelyn Stark," Don't you drink, Lord Bolton?",3,10
Roose Bolton," Never do, my Lady, dulls the senses.",3,10
Brynden Tully, That's the point. Didn't you marry one of these Frey girls?,3,10
Roose Bolton," Aye, Lord Walder let me choose any of his granddaughters and promised me the girl's weight in silver as a dowry. So, I have a fat young bride.",3,10
Catelyn Stark, I hope she makes you very happy.,3,10
Roose Bolton," Well, she's made me very rich.",3,10
Brynden Tully," Pardon, my Lord, my Lady, I need to find a tree to piss on.",3,10
Walder Frey," [To Robb] Your Grace, I fear I've been, remiss in my duties. I've given you meat and wine and music, but, I haven't shown you the hospitality you deserve. My king has married and I owe my new queen a wedding gift.",3,10
Catelyn Stark, Robb!,3,10
Walder Frey, The King in the North arises!,3,10
Catelyn Stark," Lord Walder! Lord Walder, enough! Let it end! Please! He is my son, my first son! Let him go and I swear we will forget this, I swear it by the old gods and the new, we will take no vengeance!",3,10
Walder Frey," You already swore me one oath, right here in my castle. You swore by all the gods that your son would marry my daughter!",3,10
Catelyn Stark," Take me for your hostage! But let Robb go. Robb get up, get up and walk out, please! Please!",3,10
Walder Frey, And why would I let him do that?,3,10
Catelyn Stark," On my honor as a Tully, On my honor as a Stark! Let Robb go, or I will cut your wife's throat!",3,10
Walder Frey, I'll find another.,3,10
Robb Stark, Mother...,3,10
Roose Bolton, The Lannisters send their regards.,3,10
Tyrion Lannister, Killed a few puppies today?,3,10
Joffrey Baratheon," [gestures to Pycelle] Show him. Go on, show him!",3,10
Grand Maester Pycelle," Ohhh! I'm sorry, my Lord, old fingers.",3,10
Tyrion Lannister," ""Roslin caught a fine fat trout. Her brothers gave her a pair of wolf pelts for her wedding. Signed Walder Frey."" Is that bad poetry, or is it supposed to mean something?",3,10
Joffrey Baratheon, Robb Stark is dead! And his bitch mother! Write back to Lord Frey. Thank him for his service and command him to send Robb Stark's head to me. I'm going to serve it to Sansa at my wedding feast.,3,10
Varys," Your Grace, Lady Sansa is your aunt by marriage.",3,10
Cersei Lannister, A joke. Joffrey did not mean it.,3,10
Joffrey Baratheon," Yes, I did. I'm going to have it served to Sansa at my wedding feast.",3,10
Tyrion Lannister, No. She is no longer yours to torment.,3,10
Joffrey Baratheon," Everyone is mine to torment. You'd do well to remember that, you little monster.",3,10
Tyrion Lannister," Oh, I'm a monster? Perhaps you should speak to me more softly, then. Monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies.",3,10
Joffrey Baratheon, I could have your tongue out for saying that!,3,10
Cersei Lannister, Let him make his threats. Hmm? He's a bitter little man.,3,10
Grand Maester Pycelle," Lord Tyrion should apologize immediately. Unacceptable, disrespectful, and in very bad taste!",3,10
Joffrey Baratheon, I am the KING!! I will punish you!,3,10
Tywin Lannister," Any man who must say, ""I am the king"" is no true king. I'll make sure you understand that when I've won your war for you.",3,10
Joffrey Baratheon," My father won the real war! He killed Prince Rhaegar. He took the crown, while you hid under Casterly Rock!",3,10
Tywin Lannister," [Glares at Joffrey, unfazed] ...The king is tired. See him to his chambers.",3,10
Cersei Lannister, Come along.,3,10
Joffrey Baratheon, I'm not tired.,3,10
Cersei Lannister, We have so much to celebrate. A wedding to plan. You must rest.,3,10
Tywin Lannister," Grand Maester, perhaps some essence of nightshade to help him sleep.",3,10
Joffrey Baratheon, I'm not... TIRED!!,3,10
Cersei Lannister, Come.,3,10
Tyrion Lannister, You just sent the most powerful man in Westeros to bed without his supper.,3,10
Tywin Lannister, You're a fool if you believe he's the most powerful man in Westeros.,3,10
Tyrion Lannister, A treasonous statement! Joffrey is king.,3,10
Tywin Lannister, You really think a crown gives you power?,3,10
Tyrion Lannister," No, I think armies give you power. [Tywin nods] Robb Stark had one, never lost a battle, and you defeated him all the same. [Tywin nods again] Oh, I know. Walder Frey gets all the credit, or the blame, I suppose, depending on your allegiance. Walder Frey is many things, but a brave man? No. He never would have risked such an action, unless he had certain assurances...",3,10
Tywin Lannister, Which he got from me. Do you disapprove?,3,10
Tyrion Lannister," I'm all for cheating, this is war. But to slaughter them at a wedding...",3,10
Tywin Lannister, Explain to me why it is more noble to kill ten thousand men in battle than a dozen at dinner.,3,10
Tyrion Lannister, So that's why you did it? To save lives?,3,10
Tywin Lannister," To end the war. To protect the family. Do you want to write a song for the dead Starks? Go ahead! Write one. I'm in this world a little while longer, to defend the Lannisters, to defend my blood.",3,10
Tyrion Lannister, The Northerners will never forget.,3,10
Tywin Lannister," Good. Let them remember what happens when they march on the South. All the Stark men are dead. Winterfell is a ruin. Roose Bolton will be named Warden of the North, until your son by Sansa comes of age. I believe you still have some work to do on that score.",3,10
Tyrion Lannister, Do you think she'll open her legs for me after I tell her how we murdered her mother and brother?!,3,10
Tywin Lannister," One way or another, you will get that girl pregnant-",3,10
Tyrion Lannister, I will not rape her!,3,10
Tywin Lannister, Shall I explain to you in one easy lesson how the world works?,3,10
Tyrion Lannister, Use small words. I'm not as bright as you!,3,10
Tywin Lannister," The house that puts family first will always defeat the house that puts the whims and wishes of its' sons and daughters first. A good man does everything in his power to better his family's position, regardless of his own selfish desires. [Tyrion smiles] Does that amuse you?",3,10
Tyrion Lannister," No, it's a very good lesson. Only it's easy for you to preach utter devotion to family, when you're making all the decisions!",3,10
Tywin Lannister," Easy for me, is it?",3,10
Tyrion Lannister," When have you ever done something that wasn't in your interest, but solely for the benefit of the family?",3,10
Tywin Lannister," The day that you were born. I wanted to carry you into the sea and let the waves wash you away. Instead, I let you live. And I've brought you up as my son. Because you're a Lannister!",3,10
Walder Frey," ""The late Walder Frey"" old Tully called me because I didn't get my men to the Trident in time for battle. He thought he was witty...but look at us now, Tully! You're dead, your daughter's dead, your grandson's dead, your son spent his wedding night in a dungeon and I am Lord of Riverrun! [cackles]",3,10
Roose Bolton, The Blackfish escaped.,3,10
Walder Frey," An old man on the run with no allies. I have Tywin Lannister backing me, who does he have?",3,10
Roose Bolton, As you say.,3,10
Walder Frey," They all laughed at me, all those high lords, they all thought they were better than me: Ned Stark, Hoster Tully...people snigger when I marry a young girl, but who said a word when Jon Arryn married the little Tully bitch?!",3,10
Walder Frey," They all laughed at me, all those high lords, they all thought they were better than me: Ned Stark, Hoster Tully...people snigger when I marry a young girl, but who said a word when Jon Arryn married the little Tully bitch?!",3,10
Roose Bolton, You'll be needing a new young girl.,3,10
Walder Frey, Yes...got that to look forward to. And you...the Warden of the North! No more Starks to bow and scrape to! Must have been torture following that stupid boy all over the country.,3,10
Roose Bolton, He ignored my advice at every turn. If he'd been a trifle less arrogant...,3,10
Walder Frey," Calling himself ""The Young Wolf""...how's that for pomposity? Well...[raises his goblet in mock toast] Here's to the Young Wolf! [makes a mocking wolf howl]",3,10
Roose Bolton, Forever young. [both men chuckle],3,10
Walder Frey, Will you move to Winterfell now that the war's over?,3,10
Roose Bolton," At some point, perhaps. But Winterfell's in ruins.",3,10
Walder Frey," Yes...what happened up there? I heard the Greyjoy boy seized the place. I heard he killed all the ravens and then, nothing.",3,10
Roose Bolton, I sent my bastard Ramsay to root him out. Robb Stark offered amnesty for the Ironborn if they gave us Theon.,3,10
Walder Frey, And?,3,10
Roose Bolton," [grins] Ramsay delivered the terms. The Ironborn turned on Theon as we knew they would. They handed him over, trussed and hooded, but Ramsay...well, Ramsay has his own way of doing things.",3,10
Ramsay Snow," [eating a sausage] Those girls weren't lying. You had a good sized cock. [Theon weakly looks at the sausage in horror] What? No! Pork sausage. Do you think I'm some sort of savage? When people talk about phantom limbs, an amputee might have an itch where his foot used to be. So I've always wondered, do eunuchs have a phantom cock? Next time you think about naked girls, will you feel an itch? Sorry. I shouldn't make jokes. My mother taught me not to throw stones at cripples...[grins] but my father taught me aim for their head!",3,10
Theon Greyjoy, Kill me...,3,10
Ramsay Snow," Sorry, what?",3,10
Theon Greyjoy, Kill me.,3,10
Ramsay Snow, A little louder.,3,10
Theon Greyjoy, KILL ME!,3,10
Ramsay Snow," You're no good to me dead. We need you. You don't look like Theon Greyjoy anymore. That's a name for a lord. But you're not a lord, are you? You're just...meat. Stinking meat. You reek. Reek! That's a good name for you. What's your name?",3,10
Theon Greyjoy, Theon Greyjoy.,3,10
Ramsay Snow, What's your name?,3,10
Theon Greyjoy, Th-Theon Greyjoy.,3,10
Theon Greyjoy, Please...,3,10
Ramsay Snow, What...is...your...name?!,3,10
Theon Greyjoy, Reek. My name is...Reek.,3,10
1st Frey Bannerman, What d'you want?,3,10
Arya Stark, Mind if I keep warm?,3,10
2nd Frey Bannerman, Fuck off!,3,10
Arya Stark, But I'm hungry.,3,10
1st Frey Bannerman," Does ""Fuck off"" mean something different where you're from?",3,10
Arya Stark, I've got money. [she reaches into her belt pouch and pulls out the Braavosi coin Jacquen gave her],3,10
1st Frey Bannerman, What kinda coin is that?,3,10
Arya Stark, It's worth a lot. [she drops it on the ground when he reaches for it] Sorry.,3,10
1st Frey Bannerman," Little shit. [as he leans over to pick up the coin, Arya violently stabs him several times in the back and neck. Sandor Clegane then kills all three of them.]",3,10
Sandor Clegane, Where did you get the knife?,3,10
Arya Stark, From you.,3,10
Sandor Clegane, Is that the first man you've killed?,3,10
Arya Stark, The first man.,3,10
Sandor Clegane," The next time you're going to do something like that, tell me first!",3,10
Arya Stark, [picks up the Braavosi coin] Valar Morghulis.,3,10
Jon Snow," Ygritte, you know I didn't have a choice. You always knew who I was, what I am. I have to go home now. I know you won't hurt me.",3,10
Ygritte," You know nothing, Jon Snow.",3,10
Jon Snow, I do know some things. I know I love you. I know that you love me. But I have to go home now!,3,10
First Lannister soldier ," You lost, friend?",4,1
Oberyn Martell, Forgive me for staring...I don't see many Lannisters where I'm from.,4,1
First Lannister soldier, I don't see many Dornishmen in the capital.,4,1
Oberyn Martell, We don't like the smell!,4,1
Ellaria Sand," Come with me, lover.",4,1
Second Lannister soldier," Gods, look at this one!",4,1
Olyvar," Sirs, if you follow me I'll arrange for a private room-",4,1
Second Lannister soldier, Why are you wasting a woman like this on a Dornishman? Bring him a shaved goat and a bottle of olive oil!,4,1
Oberyn Martell," Do you know why all the world hates a Lannister? You think your gold and your lions, and your gold lions make you better than everyone. May I tell you a secret? You're not a golden lion. You're just a pink little man who's far too slow on the draw.",4,1
Oberyn," Long sword is a bad option in close quarters. When I pull my blade, your friend starts bleeding, quite a lot, I'm afraid; so many veins in the wrist. [He twists the dagger slightly, causing the soldier to scream again] He'll live if you get him help, straight away. So...decisions.",4,1
Tyrion Lannister," Prince Oberyn! Forgive the intrusion, we heard there might be... [He breaks off as Oberyn wrenches his dagger free, causing the soldier to scream again] ...trouble.",4,1
Oberyn Martell," [to Ellaria] Apologies, my love. [they kiss]",4,1
Oberyn Martell, It seems I visited the Lannister brothel by mistake.,4,1
Tyrion Lannister," Oh, they take all kinds.",4,1
Oberyn Martell, Even Dornishmen.,4,1
Tyrion Lannister, The King is very grateful that you traveled all this way for his wedding.,4,1
Oberyn Martell," Ah, let us speak truth here; Joffrey is insulted. I am only the second son, after all.",4,1
Tyrion Lannister," Well, speaking as a fellow second son, I have grown rather used to being the family insult. [Oberyn chuckles] Why did you come to King's Landing, Prince Oberyn?",4,1
Oberyn Martell, I was invited to the royal wedding.,4,1
Tyrion Lannister, I thought we were speaking truth.,4,1
Oberyn Martell," The last time I was in the capital was many years ago. Another wedding. My sister Elia and Rhaegar Targaryen, the last dragon. My sister loved him. She bore his children. Swaddled them, rocked them, fed them at her own breast, Elia wouldn't let the wet nurse touch them. And beautiful, noble Rhaegar Targaryen...left her for another woman. That started a war and the war ended right here when your father's army took the city.",4,1
Tyrion Lannister, I wasn't actually present-,4,1
Oberyn Martell," They butchered those children. My nephew and niece. Carved them up and wrapped them in Lannister cloaks. And my sister, you know what they did to her? [Tyrion doesn't answer; Oberyn lifts his chin with a finger until their eyes are locked] I'm asking you a question.",4,1
Tyrion Lannister, I've heard rumors.,4,1
Oberyn Martell," So have I. The one I keep hearing is that Ser Gregor Clegane, the Mountain, raped Elia and split her in half with his greatsword.",4,1
Tyrion Lannister, I wasn't there. I don't know what happened.,4,1
Oberyn Martell," If the Mountain killed my sister, your father gave the order. Tell your father I'm here. And tell him the Lannisters aren't the only ones who pay their debts.",4,1
Jorah Mormont, There's one on every mile-marker between here and Meereen.,4,1
Daenerys Targaryen, How many miles are there between here and Meereen?,4,1
Jorah Mormont," One hundred and sixty-three, Your Grace.",4,1
Barristan Selmy, I'll tell our men to ride ahead and bury them. You don't need to see this.,4,1
Daenerys Targaryen," You will do no such thing. I will see each and every one of their faces. Remove her collar, before you bury her.",4,1
Alliser Thorne, So you admit you murdered Qhorin Halfhand?,4,1
Jon Snow, I didn't murder him.,4,1
Alliser Thorne, No? You put your sword through a brother of the Night's Watch. What do you call that?,4,1
Jon Snow, He wanted me to kill him.,4,1
Janos Slynt, A bastard son of a traitor. What would you expect?,4,1
Jon Snow, The Halfhand believed our only chance to stop Mance was to get a man inside his army.,4,1
Alliser Thorne, Don't talk about the Halfhand as if you knew him. He was my brother.,4,1
Jon Snow," Then you'd know he'd do anything to defend the Wall. The free folk would have boiled him alive, but letting me kill him...",4,1
Janos Slynt, The free folk? Listen to him. He even talks like a wildling now.,4,1
Jon Snow," Aye, I talk like a wildling. I ate with the wildlings. I climbed the Wall with the wildlings. I...I laid with a wildling girl.",4,1
Janos Slynt," You admit to breaking your vows, then?",4,1
Jon Snow, I do.,4,1
Janos Slynt, The law is the law. The boy must die.,4,1
Maester Aemon," If we beheaded every ranger who lay with a girl, the Wall would be manned by headless men.",4,1
Alliser Thorne, There's a difference between sneaking off to the Mole's Town brothel and sleeping with the enemy.,4,1
Jon Snow," While we sit here, debating which rules I broke, Mance Rayder marches on the Wall with an army of a hundred thousand.",4,1
Alliser Thorne, Impossible. You can't get fifty wildlings together before they start killing each other.,4,1
Jon Snow," One hundred thousand. He's united the Thenns, the Hornfoots, the ice-river clans, there's giants'fighting for him.",4,1
Janos Slynt, Giants?,4,1
Jon Snow," Have you ever been beyond the Wall, ser?",4,1
Janos Slynt," I commanded the City Watch of King's Landing, boy.",4,1
Jon Snow, And now you're here. You must not have been very good at your job.,4,1
Janos Slynt, How dare you?!,4,1
Jon Snow," There's a band of wildlings south of the Wall already, led by Tormund Giantsbane. I killed their warg and three others. They shot me full of arrows. Their orders are to attack Castle Black from the south when Mance hits it from the north. The signal for the attack will be a bonfire. Mance said it would be the greatest fire the North has ever seen. That's the truth. All the truth. Do you intend to execute me or am I free to go?",4,1
Maester Aemon," None of us are free. We are men of the Night's Watch. But we won't be taking your head today, Jon Snow.",4,1
Polliver," Hey, I know you. You're the Hound! Pour our new friend some ale! What brings you so far north?",4,1
Sandor Clegane, I could ask the same of you. What're you doing up here?,4,1
Polliver, Just keepin' the King's peace.,4,1
Sandor Clegane," No need, war's over.",4,1
Polliver," So I've heard. Stannis defeated at the Blackwater, Robb Stark killed at the Twins, and where am I for all of it? Stuck with your brother. Meaning no offense.",4,1
Sandor Clegane, None taken.,4,1
Polliver," He's good, the Mountain is. Best at what he does. But torture, torture, torture, torture. You spend enough time puttin' a hammer to people, and you start to feel like a carpenter making chairs. Drains the fun right out of it! And what's life without a little fun? Well, I don't need to tell you that, eh?",4,1
Sandor Clegane, She's all right. I've had better.,4,1
Polliver," You know what? You should come with us. His kind, they've always got something hidden away, gold, silver, more daughters. Always something, if you know how to make em talk and there's plenty of 'em between here and King's Landing. You could do well for yourself. We certainly have been!",4,1
Sandor Clegane, I'm not going to King's Landing.,4,1
Polliver," But think about it. We can do whatever we like, wherever we go! These are the King's colors. No one's standing in his way now... which means no one's standing in ours.",4,1
Sandor Clegane, Fuck the King.,4,1
Polliver," When I heard that Joffrey's dog had turned tail and run at the Battle of the Blackwater, I didn't believe it. But, here you are.",4,1
Sandor Clegane, Here I am. Bring me one of those chickens.,4,1
Polliver, You got money to pay for it?,4,1
Sandor Clegane, You paid for it?,4,1
Polliver," No, but we're the King's men. So, you got money?",4,1
Sandor Clegane, Not a penny. I'll still take that chicken.,4,1
Polliver, Tell you what. We'll trade you. One of our little chickens for one of yours. Give us a go at your friend. Lowell there likes them a bit broken in.,4,1
Sandor Clegane, You're a talker. Listening to talkers...makes me thirsty. And hungry. Think I'll take two chickens.,4,1
Polliver, You don't seem to understand the situation.,4,1
Sandor Clegane," I understand, that if any more words come pouring out your cunt mouth... I'm gonna have to eat every fucking chicken in this room.",4,1
Polliver, You lived your life for the King. You gonna die for some chickens?,4,1
Sandor Clegane, Someone is.,4,1
Jaime Lannister," My brother tells me you keep your mouth shut. Unusual talent, for a sellsword.",4,2
Bronn," He tells me you shit gold, just like your father.",4,2
Jaime Lannister, Is this place safe?,4,2
Bronn," There's this knight, er, Laygood. Got thunderbolts on his shield? [Jaime nods] Right here is where I fuck his wife. She's a screamer, that one. If they don't hear her, they won't hear us. [whistles as Jaime draws his sword] I've never seen Valyrian steel before. She's a beauty. Problem is, if you fight with an edged blade, I'll have to. And if I fight with an edged blade, I'll have no one left to pay me. [pulls two blunted swords out of his bag and drops one on the ground]",4,2
Jaime Lannister," I haven't used a sparring sword since I was nine. [just as he grabs the practice sword, Bronn hits him on the wrist with his blade, forcing him to drop it] Bold warrior you are, attacking a man when his guard's down.",4,2
Bronn," Best time to attack a man. [attacks as Jaime picks up the sword; they spar for a moment, then Bronn shoves him against a rock wall] Mind yourself!",4,2
Jaime Lannister, If I still had my right hand...,4,2
Bronn, Plan on growin' it back?,4,2
Ramsay Snow," Father. [shoves Theon forward, Roose gets up and inspects him more closely]",4,2
Roose Bolton, What did you do to him?,4,2
Ramsay Snow," I trained him. He was a slow learner, but he learned.",4,2
Roose Bolton, You flayed him.,4,2
Ramsay Snow, Peeled a few bits. Removed a few others.,4,2
Roose Bolton, This was Balon Greyjoy's son and heir.,4,2
Ramsay Snow, We've been flaying our enemies for a thousand years. The flayed man is on our banners.,4,2
Roose Bolton," My banners, not yours. You're not a Bolton, you're a Snow. Tywin Lannister has given me the North, but he won't lift a finger to help me take it. As long as the Ironborn hold Moat Cailin, our armies are trapped south of the Neck. Theon was a valuable hostage, not your plaything. I wanted to trade him for Moat Cailin.",4,2
Ramsay Snow, I already asked. Lord Greyjoy refused. Savages have...,4,2
Roose Bolton, You sent terms to Balon Greyjoy without my consent?,4,2
Ramsay Snow, You made me Acting Lord of the Dreadfort. I acted.,4,2
Roose Bolton, I had to smuggle myself into my own lands thanks to the Greyjoys. I needed Theon. I needed him whole.,4,2
Ramsay Snow, Theon was our enemy. But Reek? Reek will never betray us.,4,2
Roose Bolton, I place far too much trust in you.,4,2
Ramsay Snow," Reek, how could you let me stand before my father unshaven? It's disrespectful.",4,2
Theon Greyjoy," Sorry, my lord.",4,2
Ramsay Snow, [to Locke] Give him the razor.,4,2
Ramsay Snow," I'm not a Bolton, father. What does it matter? Go on, Reek. A nice, close shave.",4,2
Oberyn Martell, Your Grace. Lord Tywin.,4,2
Tywin Lannister, Prince Oberyn.,4,2
Oberyn Martell," I don't believe you have met Ellaria. This is the Lord Hand Tywin Lannister and Cersei Lannister the Queen Regent. I suppose it is former Queen Regent now. Lord Hand and Lady Cersei, Ellaria Sand.",4,2
Ellaria Sand, My lord. My lady.,4,2
Tywin Lannister, Charmed.,4,2
Cersei Lannister, Can't say I've ever met a Sand before.,4,2
Ellaria Sand," We are everywhere in Dorne. I have 10,000 brothers and sisters.",4,2
Oberyn Martell," Bastards are born of passion, aren't they? We don't despise them in Dorne.",4,2
Cersei Lannister, No? How tolerant of you.,4,2
Oberyn Martell," I expect it is a relief, Lady Cersei, giving up your regal responsibilities. Wearing the crown for so many years must have left your neck a bit crooked.",4,2
Cersei Lannister," I suppose you'll never know, Prince Oberyn. It's a shame your older brother couldn't attend the wedding.",4,2
Tywin Lannister," Please give him our regards. With any luck, the gout will abate with time and he will be able to walk again.",4,2
Oberyn Martell," They call it the rich man's disease. A wonder you don't have it, Lord Tywin.",4,2
Tywin Lannister, Noblemen in my part of the country don't enjoy the same lifestyle as our counterparts in Dorne.,4,2
Oberyn Martell," People everywhere have their differences. In some places the highborn frown upon those of low birth. In other places, the rape and murder of women and children is considered...distasteful. What a fortunate thing for you, former Queen Regent, that your daughter Myrcella has been sent to live in the latter sort of place.",4,2
Joffrey Baratheon," Well fought. Well fought. Here you are. Champion's purse. Though you're not the champion yet, are you? A true champion defeats all the challengers. Surely there are others out there who still dare to challenge my reign. Uncle. How about you? I'm sure they have a spare costume.",4,2
Tyrion Lannister," One taste of combat was enough for me, Your Grace. I would like to keep what remains of my face. I think you should fight him. This was but a poor imitation of your own bravery on the field of battle. I speak as a firsthand witness. Climb down from the high table with your new Valyrian sword and show everyone how a true king wins his throne. Be careful, though. [Nods towards the champion dwarf.] This one is clearly mad with lust. It would be a tragedy for the king to lose his virtue hours before his wedding night.",4,2
Tyrion Lannister, A fine vintage. Shame that it spilled.,4,2
Joffrey Baratheon, It did not spill.,4,2
Margaery Tyrell," My love, come back to me. It's time for my father's toast.",4,2
Joffrey Baratheon," Well, how does he expect me to toast without wine? [To Tyrion] Uncle, you can be my cupbearer seeing as you're too cowardly to fight.",4,2
Tyrion Lannister, Your Grace does me a fine honor.,4,2
Joffrey Baratheon, It's not meant as an honor.,4,2
Joffrey Baratheon, Bring me my goblet.,4,2
Joffrey Baratheon, What good is an empty cup? Fill it. [Tyrion fills the cup with wine and hands it to Joffrey] Kneel. [Tyrion looks at him] Kneel before your king. [Pause] Kneel. [Pause as Tyrion glares at Joffrey; Getting angry] I said... kneel! [Tyrion keeps glaring at him],4,2
Margaery Tyrell," Look, the pie.",4,2
Joffrey Baratheon," Uncle. Where are you going? You're my cupbearer, remember?",4,2
Tyrion Lannister," I thought I might change out of these wet clothes, Your Grace.",4,2
Joffrey Baratheon," No, no, no. No, you're perfect the way you are. Serve me my wine. Well, hurry up. This pie is dry. [He hands the cup to Joffrey, who gulps at it] Mm, good. Needs washing down.",4,2
Tyrion Lannister," If it please Your Grace, Lady Sansa is very tired.",4,2
Joffrey Baratheon," No. [coughs] No, you'll wait here... [coughs again] un-- [continues coughing]",4,2
Tyrion Lannister, Your Grace?,4,2
Joffrey Baratheon," [short of breath, he takes a gulp of wine to try and alleviate his coughing] It's nothing.",4,2
Margaery Tyrell, He's choking!,4,2
Olenna Tyrell," Help the poor boy. [Joffrey staggers away from the table, choking frantically.] Idiots, help your king.",4,2
Jaime Lannister," Move away! [He pushes his way through the crowd and runs towards Joffrey as he collapses, choking and vomiting.] Joffrey! Joffrey!",4,2
Cersei Lannister, Help him! Someone help him! Joffrey!,4,2
Dontos Hollard, [to Sansa] Come with me now.,4,2
Cersei Lannister, Joffrey! Joffrey!,4,2
Dontos Hollard," [to Sansa] If you want to live, we have to leave.",4,2
Cersei Lannister," Don't touch him! Joffrey. Please, Joffrey. Joffrey, what is it? Help him!",4,2
Cersei Lannister, My son. [sobbing],4,2
Man, He's gone. Our king is gone.,4,2
Cersei Lannister," [turning to glare at Tyrion] He did this. He poisoned my son, your king. Take him. Take him! Take him! Take him!",4,2
Tywin Lannister, Your brother is dead. Do you know what that means? [Tommen hesitates in answering] I'm not trying to trick you.,4,3
Tommen Baratheon, It means I'll become king.,4,3
Tywin Lannister," Yes, you will become king. What kind of king do you think you will be?",4,3
Tommen Baratheon, A good king?,4,3
Tywin Lannister," I think so as well; you have the right temperament for it. But what makes a good king, hmm? What is a good king's single most important quality?",4,3
Cersei Lannister, This is hardly the place or the time!,4,3
Tommen Baratheon, Holiness?,4,3
Tywin Lannister, Baelor the Blessed was holy and pious. He built this sept. He also named a six year old boy High Septon because he thought the boy could work miracles. He ended up fasting himself into an early grave because food was of this world and this world was sinful.,4,3
Tommen Baratheon, Justice?,4,3
Tywin Lannister," A good king must be just. Orys the First was just; everyone applauded his reforms, nobles and commoners alike, but he wasn't just for long. He was murdered in his sleep after less than a year by his own brother. Was that truly just of him, to abandon his subjects to an evil that he was too gullible to recognize?",4,3
Tommen Baratheon, No. What about strength?,4,3
Tywin Lannister," Yes, strength. King Robert was strong; he won the rebellion and crushed the Targaryen dynasty. And he attended three Small Council meetings in seventeen years of ruling, and he spent his time whoring, hunting and drinking until the last two killed him. So, we have a man who starves himself to death, a man who lets his own brother murder him and a man who thinks winning and ruling are the same thing. What do they all lack?",4,3
Tommen Baratheon, Wisdom?,4,3
Tywin Lannister, Yes!,4,3
Tommen Baratheon, Wisdom is what makes a good king.,4,3
Tywin Lannister, Yes. But what is wisdom? A house with great wealth and fertile lands asks you for your protection against another house with a strong navy that could one day oppose you. How do you know which choice is wise and which is not? Any experience of treasuries and granaries? Or shipyards and soldiers?,4,3
Tommen Baratheon, No.,4,3
Tywin Lannister," Of course not. A wise king knows what he knows and what he doesn't. You're young. A wise young king listens to his councilors and heeds their advice until he comes of age. And the wisest kings continue to listen to them long afterwards. Your brother was not a wise king. Your brother was not a good king. If he had been, he'd probably still be alive.",4,3
Tyrion Lannister, [in his cell] Podrick. Apologies for the stench.,4,3
Podrick Payne," I brought you some wine, m'Lord, but they took it from me.",4,3
Tyrion Lannister, A noble effort.,4,3
Podrick Payne," They didn't find the candles, though [starts laying items on a bench] A quill, some parchment, duck sausage, almonds, and some hard cheese.",4,3
Tyrion Lannister, You're a good lad. Any word of Shae?,4,3
Podrick Payne," I've heard nothing, my Lord.",4,3
Tyrion Lannister," I suppose that's a good thing. What are they saying about me, out there?",4,3
Podrick Payne," You're to stand trial, in a fortnight- for murdering the King.",4,3
Tyrion Lannister, Do you believe I murdered Joffrey?,4,3
Podrick Payne," No, m'Lord. You didn't.",4,3
Tyrion Lannister," No. Gods, no. The world is a better place without him, but I had nothing to do with it. I'd like to think, if I were planning a Royal assassination, I would arrange it in such a way that I wouldn't be standing there, gawking like a fool when the King died. Trial in a fortnight... have they announced the judges yet?",4,3
Podrick Payne, Your father.,4,3
Tyrion Lannister, Of course.,4,3
Podrick Payne, Lord Mace Tyrell.,4,3
Tyrion Lannister, Who will vote exactly as my father tells him to vote.,4,3
Podrick Payne, And Prince Oberyn of Dorne.,4,3
Tyrion Lannister, Oberyn? [laughs] Leave it to my father.Never fails to take advantage of a family tragedy.,4,3
Podrick Payne," I'm supposed to get a list of names from you, my Lord. Anyone who might testify on your behalf.",4,3
Tyrion Lannister," Oh! I can call my own witnesses? How generous of them! Very well. My wife, Sansa.",4,3
Podrick Payne," My Lord, she's gone.",4,3
Tyrion Lannister, Gone?,4,3
Podrick Payne," No one's seen her, since the wedding. You don't think she...",4,3
Tyrion Lannister," No one had more cause to kill Joffrey than Sansa, but the girl's no assassin. No, whoever killed the King wanted me to lose my head for it and with my wife's disappearance, it makes me seem that much more guilty. Podrick.",4,3
Podrick Payne," Yes, my Lord?",4,3
Tyrion Lannister," They'll be following you, now.",4,3
Podrick Payne," Who, my Lord?",4,3
Tyrion Lannister," I don't know! They, they! The ominous ""They""! The men pulling the strings, or women. My father. Maybe Joffrey was too much work for him. Sweet Tommen will be so much easier to handle. Whenever something bad happens to me, I assume it's my sister that had a hand in it. But say what you will of Cersei, she loves her children. She is the only one I'm certain had nothing to do with this murder... which makes this unique, as King's Landing murders go.",4,3
Davos Seaworth," Westeros is not the world, Your Grace. We need to look east for ships and men. 10,000 skilled soldiers fight for the Golden Company.",4,3
Stannis Baratheon, [disgusted] The Golden Company?,4,3
Davos Seaworth, They've never broken a contract.,4,3
Stannis Baratheon, They're sellswords.,4,3
Davos Seaworth," We're willing to use blood magic to put you on the throne, but we're not willing to pay men to fight? Now the Red Woman's magic is real. Her visions and prophecies may be, too, but I've never heard of visions and prophecies winning a war. Soldiers win wars. Soldiers on the ground. It's dirty on the ground.",4,3
Stannis Baratheon, We don't have any gold.,4,3
Davos Seaworth, Not yet.,4,3
Stannis Baratheon," If I do not press my claim, my claim will be forgotten. I will not become a page in someone else's history book. I'm running out of time, Ser Davos. Which means you're running out of time.",4,3
Oberyn Martell, I'm sorry about your grandson.,4,3
Tywin Lannister, Are you?,4,3
Oberyn Martell, I don't believe that a child is responsible for the sins of his father or his grandfather. An awful way to die...,4,3
Tywin Lannister, Which way is that?,4,3
Oberyn Martell," Are you interrogating me, Lord Tywin?",4,3
Tywin Lannister, Some believe the king choked.,4,3
Oberyn Martell, Some believe the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant. The king was poisoned.,4,3
Tywin Lannister, I hear you studied poisons at the Citadel.,4,3
Oberyn Martell, I did. This is why I know.,4,3
Tywin Lannister," Your hatred for my family is...rather well known. You arrive in the capital, an expert in poisoning; some days later, my grandson dies of poisoning.",4,3
Oberyn Martell, Rather suspicious. Why haven't you thrown me in a dungeon?,4,3
Tywin Lannister, You spoke with Tyrion in this very brothel on the day you arrived. What did you discuss?,4,3
Oberyn Martell, [amused] You think we conspired together?,4,3
Tywin Lannister, What did you discuss?,4,3
Oberyn Martell, The death of my sister.,4,3
Tywin Lannister, For which you blame me.,4,3
Oberyn Martell, She was raped and murdered by the Mountain. The Mountain follows your orders. Of course I blame you.,4,3
Tywin Lannister," I stand before you unarmed, unguarded. Should I be worried?",4,3
Oberyn Martell," You are unarmed and unguarded because you know me better than that. I'm a man of reason; if I slit your throat today, I will be drawn and quartered tomorrow.",4,3
Tywin Lannister," Men at war commit all kinds of crimes, without their superiors' knowledge.",4,3
Oberyn Martell, So you're denying involvement in Elia's murder?,4,3
Tywin Lannister," Categorically. [long pause, then Oberyn turns away]",4,3
Oberyn Martell, I would like to speak with the Mountain.,4,3
Tywin Lannister, I'm sure he would enjoy speaking with you.,4,3
Oberyn Martell, He might not enjoy it as he thinks he would.,4,3
Tywin Lannister, I could arrange for this meeting-,4,3
Oberyn Martell, But you want something in return.,4,3
Tywin Lannister," There will be a trial for my son and as custom dictates, three judges will render a verdict. I will preside, Mace Tyrell will serve as the second judge and I would like you to be the third.",4,3
Oberyn Martell, Why?,4,3
Tywin Lannister," Not long ago, the Tyrells sided with Renly Baratheon, declared themselves enemies of the throne; now they are our strongest allies-",4,3
Oberyn Martell," Well, you made the Tyrell girl a Queen. Asking me to judge at your son's trial isn't quite as tempting.",4,3
Tywin Lannister," I will also invite you to sit on the Small Council, to serve as one of the new king's principal advisors. [Oberyn sips his wine, then turns around]",4,3
Oberyn Martell," I never realized you had such respect for Dorne, Lord Tywin.",4,3
Tywin Lannister," We are not Seven Kingdoms until Dorne returns to the fold. The king is dead, the Greyjoys are in open rebellion, a wildling army marches on the Wall and in the East, a Targaryen girl has three dragons. Before long, she will turn her eyes to Westeros. Only the Dornish managed to resist Aegon Targaryen and his dragons.",4,3
Oberyn Martell, [grins] You're saying you need us? That must be hard for you to admit.,4,3
Tywin Lannister, We need each other. You help me serve justice to the King's assassins... and I will help you serve justice to Elia's. [Offers Oberyn his hand to shake],4,3
Daenerys Targaryen," I am Daenerys Stormborn. Your Masters may have told you lies about me, or they may have told you nothing. It does not matter. I have nothing to say to them. I only speak to you. First, I went to Astapor. Those who were slaves in Astapor, now stand behind me, free. Next I went to Yunkai. Those who were slaves in Yunkai, now stand behind me, free. Now I have come to Meereen. I am not your enemy. Your enemy is beside you. Your enemy steals and murders your children. Your enemy has nothing for you but chains and suffering, and commands. I do not bring you commands. I bring you a choice. And I bring your enemies what they deserve.",4,3
Daenerys Targaryen," Remind me, Ser Jorah, how many children did the Great Masters nail to mileposts?",4,4
Jorah Mormont," 163, Khaleesi.",4,4
Daenerys Targaryen," Yes, that was it.",4,4
Barristan Semly," Your Grace, may I have a word? The city is yours. All these people, they're your subjects now. Sometimes it is better to answer injustice with mercy.",4,4
Daenerys Targaryen, I will answer injustice with justice.,4,4
Jaime Lannister," To tell you the truth, this isn't so bad. Four walls. A pot to piss in. I was chained to a wooden post covered in my own shit for months.",4,4
Tyrion Lannister, Is that supposed to make me feel better?,4,4
Jaime Lannister, Maybe a bit. I'm sorry I didn't come sooner.,4,4
Tyrion Lannister," It's complicated, yes. So how is our sister?",4,4
Jaime Lannister, How do you think? Her son died in her arms.,4,4
Tyrion Lannister, Her son?,4,4
Jaime Lannister, Don't. [Pause] You know what's coming?,4,4
Tyrion Lannister," My trial for regicide. Yes, I know. I know the whole bloody country thinks I'm guilty. I know that one of my three judges has wished me dead more times than I can count. And that judge is my father. As for Cersei, well, she's probably working on a way to avoid a trial altogether by having me killed.",4,4
Jaime Lannister," Now that you mention it, she did ask.",4,4
Tyrion Lannister," So, should I turn around and close my eyes?",4,4
Jaime Lannister, Depends. Did you do it?,4,4
Tyrion Lannister, The Kingslayer brothers. You like it? I like it. You're really asking if I killed your son?,4,4
Jaime Lannister, Are you really asking if I'd kill my brother? How can I help you?,4,4
Tyrion Lannister," Well, you could set me free.",4,4
Jaime Lannister, You know I can't.,4,4
Tyrion Lannister, Then there's really nothing else to say.,4,4
Jaime Lannister, What do you want me to do? Kill the guards? Sneak you out of the city in the back of a cart? I'm the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.,4,4
Tyrion Lannister," Sorry, I'd forgotten. I'd hate for you to do something inappropriate.",4,4
Jaime Lannister, Inappropriate? You're accused of killing the king. Freeing you is treason.,4,4
Tyrion Lannister, Except I didn't do it.,4,4
Jaime Lannister, Which is why we're having a trial.,4,4
Tyrion Lannister," A trial. If the killer threw himself before the Iron Throne, confessed to his crimes, and gave irrefutable evidence of his guilt, it wouldn't matter to Cersei. She won't rest until my head's on a spike.",4,4
Jaime Lannister, Not just yours. She's offering a knighthood to whomever finds Sansa Stark.,4,4
Tyrion Lannister, Sansa couldn't have done this.,4,4
Jaime Lannister, She had more reason than anyone in the Seven Kingdoms. Do you think it's a coincidence she disappeared the same night Joffrey died?,4,4
Tyrion Lannister," No, but... Sansa's not a killer. Not yet, anyway.",4,4
Sansa Stark, Where are you taking me?,4,4
Petyr Baelish," I'm getting married to your aunt, Lhysa. She's waiting for us at the Eyrie. You'll be safe there.",4,4
Sansa Stark, Did you kill Joffrey?,4,4
Petyr Baelish," [smiles] Did I kill Joffrey? I've been in the Vale, for weeks.",4,4
Sansa Stark, I know it was you.,4,4
Petyr Baelish, [gives her a mocking smile] And who helped me with this conspiracy?,4,4
Sansa Stark," Well, there was Ser Dontos...You used him to get me out of King's Landing, but you would never trust him to kill the King.",4,4
Petyr Baelish, Why not?,4,4
Sansa Stark, Because you're too smart to trust a drunk.,4,4
Petyr Baelish," Then, perhaps it was your husband.",4,4
Sansa Stark, No.,4,4
Petyr Baelish, How do you know?,4,4
Sansa Stark, I just do.,4,4
Petyr Baelish," You're right. He wasn't involved in Joffrey's death. But you were. [Sansa stares at him] Do you remember that lovely necklace Dontos gave you? I don't suppose you noticed that a stone was missing, after the feast...",4,4
Sansa Stark," The poison. [he smiles] I don't understand! The Lannisters gave you wealth, power. Joffrey made you the Lord of Harrenhal!",4,4
Petyr Baelish," [shrugs] A man with no motive is a man no one suspects. Always keep your foes confused. If they don't know who you are, or what you want they can't know what you plan to do next.",4,4
Sansa Stark," I don't believe you. If they catch you, they'll put your head on a spike, just like my father's. You'd risk that, just to confuse them?",4,4
Petyr Baelish," So many men, they risk so little. They spend their lives avoiding danger. And then they die. I'd risk everything to get what I want.",4,4
Sansa Stark, And what do you want?,4,4
Petyr Baelish, Everything. My friendship with the Lannisters was productive... but Joffrey? A vicious boy with a crown on his head. He's not a reliable ally. Who could trust a friend like that?,4,4
Sansa Stark, Who could trust you?,4,4
Petyr Baelish," I don't want friends like me. My new friends are predictable, very reasonable people. As for what happened to Joffrey, well... that was something my new friends wanted, very badly. Nothing like a thoughtful gift to make a new friendship grow strong.",4,4
Margaery Tyrell, I can't believe you're going. Leaving me with these people!,4,4
Olenna Tyrell," The time has come, my dear. There's nothing more tedious than a trial... except perhaps these gardens. If I have to take one more leisurely stroll through the gardens, I'll fling myself from the cliffs. Have you been to see Tommen yet?",4,4
Margaery Tyrell, No. Have they even agreed to the match? No one tells me anything.,4,4
Olenna Tyrell," I wasn't originally engaged to marry your grandfather Luthor, you know. He was engaged to marry my sister, your great-aunt Viola. I was engaged to marry some Targaryen or other. Marrying a Targaryen was all the rage, back then. But the moment I saw my intended with his twitchy little ferret's face and ludicrous silver hair, I knew he wouldn't do. So, the evening before Luthor was to propose to my sister, I got lost on my way back from my embroidery lesson and'happened upon his chambers. How absent-minded of me.",4,4
Margaery Tyrell, Mm-hmm.,4,4
Olenna Tyrell," The following morning, Luthor never made it down the stairs to propose to my sister, because the boy couldn't bloody walk. [Margaery laughs] And once he could, the only thing he wanted was what I'd given him, the night before. I was good. I was very, very good. You are even better, but you need to act quickly. Cersei may be vicious, but she's not stupid. She'll turn the boy against you as soon as she can. And by the time you're married, it'll be too late. Luckily for you, the Queen Regent is rather distracted at the moment, mourning her dear departed boy. Accusing her brother of his murder, which, he didn't commit.",4,4
Margaery Tyrell," Well, he could have done.",4,4
Olenna Tyrell," Oh, he could have done, but he didn't.",4,4
Margaery Tyrell," You don't know, Grandmother.",4,4
Olenna Tyrell," [gives her a direct look] But I do know. [Margaery stares at her in shock] You don't think I'd have let you marry that beast, do you?",4,4
Margaery Tyrell, What? I don't understand...,4,4
Olenna Tyrell, Shhhh. Don't you worry yourself about all that. You just do what needs to be done.,4,4
Brienne of Tarth," [reading from ""The History of the Kingsguard""] ""Ser Jaime Lannister. Knighted and named to the Kingsguard in his sixteenth year. At the Sack of King's Landing, murdered his King, Aerys the Second. Pardoned by Robert Baratheon; thereafter known as Ser Kingslayer.""",4,4
Jaime Lannister," It's the duty of the Lord Commander to fill those pages. And there's still room left on mine. [he hefts a sword, balancing it awkwardly on his maimed arm, and hands it to Brienne, who examines it carefully]",4,4
Brienne of Tarth, Valyrian steel. [Jaime nods],4,4
Jaime Lannister, It's yours.,4,4
Brienne of Tarth, I can't accept-,4,4
Jaime Lannister," It's reforged from Ned Stark's sword. We'll use it to defend Ned Stark's daughter. We swore an oath to return the Stark girls to their mother. Lady Stark's dead. Arya's probably dead, too, but there's still a chance to find Sansa, and get her somewhere safe. [pause] I've got something else for you. [pulls a curtain off a specially made suit of armor] I hope I got your measurements right.",4,4
Brienne of Tarth, I'll find her. For Lady Catelyn. And for you.,4,4
Margaery Tyrell, Your Grace?,4,5
Cersei Lannister, [they both watch her son Tommen] There he is.,4,5
Margaery Tyrell, Long may he reign.,4,5
Cersei Lannister, Long may he reign.,4,5
Margaery Tyrell, He sits the Throne like he was born to it.,4,5
Cersei Lannister," Yes. He wasn't, though, was he?",4,5
Margaery Tyrell," No, he wasn't.",4,5
Cersei Lannister, You still mourn for Joffrey?,4,5
Margaery Tyrell," He was my husband, my King.",4,5
Cersei Lannister, He would have been your nightmare.,4,5
Margaery Tyrell," Your Grace, I-",4,5
Cersei Lannister," You knew exactly what he was. I did, too. You never love anything in the world the way you love your first child. It doesn't matter what they do. And what he did, it shocked me. Do you think I'm easily shocked?",4,5
Margaery Tyrell, No.,4,5
Cersei Lannister," The things he did shocked me. [they look towards Tommen] He's only a boy. A good boy, a decent boy, he always has been. Who was the last decent king, I wonder? He could be the first man to sit on that throne in fifty years to actually deserve it.",4,5
Margaery Tyrell," It would be some consolation, wouldn't it? For all the horror that put him there.",4,5
Cersei Lannister, He will need help if he's going to rule well.,4,5
Margaery Tyrell, He has you.,4,5
Cersei Lannister," A mother is not enough. You're still interested in being Queen, I take it?",4,5
Margaery Tyrell," After all that's happened? It sounds strange, I know, but I haven't given any thought to it. What comes next. It would be a great honor, of course. But I will have to speak to my father about it.",4,5
Cersei Lannister," Yes, speak to your father. I'll speak to mine.",4,5
Margaery Tyrell," We may be faced with an alarming number of weddings soon. I won't even know what to call you. Sister, or Mother?",4,5
Jorah Mormont, Joffrey Baratheon is dead. Murdered at his own wedding.,4,5
Barristan Selmy," And we've taken the Meereenese Navy, Your Grace.",4,5
Daario Naharis, The Second Sons took the Meereenese Navy.,4,5
Daenerys Targaryen, Who told you to take their Navy?,4,5
Daario Naharis, No one.,4,5
Daenerys Targaryen, So why did you do it?,4,5
Daario Naharis, I heard you like ships.,4,5
Daenerys Targaryen, How many ships?,4,5
Barristan Selmy," Ninety-three, Your Grace.",4,5
Daenerys Targaryen, How many men can they carry?,4,5
Barristan Selmy," Ninety-three hundred, not counting sailors.",4,5
Daenerys Targaryen, Would that be enough to take King's Landing?,4,5
Jorah Mormont, The Lannisters have more.,4,5
Barristan Selmy," They've been fighting Joffrey's mad wars for years. They're tired, dispersed, and now their King is dead. 8,000 Unsullied and 2,000 Second Sons sail into Blackwater Bay, storm the gates without warning...",4,5
Jorah Mormount, It's hard to say. Could be enough... but we're not fighting to make you Queen of King's Landing. Ten thousand men cannot conquer Westeros.,4,5
Barristan Selmy, The old Houses will flock to our Queen when she crosses the Narrow Sea.,4,5
Jorah Mormount," The old Houses will flock to whichever side they think will win, as they always have. There's other news, from Yunkai. Without the Unsullied to enforce your rule, the Wise Masters have re-taken control of the city. They've re-enslaved what freed men have stayed behind and sworn to take revenge against you. And in Astapor, the council you installed to rule over the city has been overthrown by a butcher named Cleon, who's declared himself 'His Imperial Majesty'.",4,5
Daenerys Targaryen," Please leave me. Not you, Jorah. It appears my liberation of Slaver's Bay isn't going quite as planned.",4,5
Jorah Mormont," You could sail for Westeros and leave it all behind. A boy sits on the Iron Throne, a boy whom many believe to be a bastard with no right to it. They have never been more vulnerable.",4,5
Daenerys Targaryen," You counseled me against rashness in Qarth. I didn't listen, but all worked out well. How can I rule seven Kingdoms if I can't control Slaver's Bay? Why should anyone trust me? Why should anyone follow me?",4,5
Jorah Mormont, You're a Targaryen. You're the Mother of Dragons.,4,5
Daenerys Targaryen, I need to be more than that. I will not let those I have freed slide back into chains. I will not sail for Westeros.,4,5
Jorah Mormont," What, then?",4,5
Daenerys Targaryen, I will do what Queens do. I will rule.,4,5
Lysa Arryn, What took you so long?,4,5
Petyr Baelish," Arranging for the ascension of King Tommen I, extricating Sansa, getting her here alive.",4,5
Lysa Arryn, She's here. We've spent more than enough time on her for one evening. Let's get married tonight.,4,5
Petyr Baelish, Ought we not inform the Lords of the Vale about the ceremony?,4,5
Lysa Arryn," There's only one Lord of the Vale. The others can all hang. Lurking and simpering on the stairs like buzzards the moment my husband died, trying to get their claws in me.",4,5
Petyr Baelish, I do think that we could wait until...,4,5
Lysa Arryn," I'm done waiting, Petyr. We had our wedding night many years ago. Or don't you remember?",4,5
Petyr Baelish, Like it was yesterday.,4,5
Lysa Arryn," What wife would do for you the things I've done for you? What wife would trust you the way I've trusted you? When you gave me those drops and told me to pour them into Jon's wine, my husband's wine. When you told me to write a letter to Cat telling her it was the Lannisters.",4,5
Petyr Baelish," The deed is done. Faded into nothing. Only speaking of it can make it real. Tonight it is, then. Let me bathe and dress for the occasion. Once I'm presentable, I'll call on the septon immediately.",4,5
Lysa Arryn," I'm warning you. I'm going to scream when my husband makes love to me. I'm going to scream so loud, they'll hear me clear across the Narrow Sea.",4,5
Arya Stark, Joffrey...Cersei...Walder Frey...Meryn Trant...Tywin Lannister...The Red Woman...Beric Dondarrion...Thoros of Myr...Illyn Payne...The Mountain...,4,5
Sandor Clegane, Would you shut up?,4,5
Arya Stark, I can't sleep until I say the names.,4,5
Sandor Clegane, The names of every fucking person in Westeros?,4,5
Arya Stark, Only the ones I'm going to kill.,4,5
Sandor Clegane," Huh. Hate's as good a thing as any to keep a man going, better than most. [pause] We come across my brother, maybe we can both cross a name off a list.",4,5
Arya Stark," If he were here right now, what would you do?",4,5
Sandor Clegane," I'd tell him to shut the fuck up so I can get some sleep. Go on, get it over with, your list of doomed men.",4,5
Arya Stark, I'm almost done. Only one name left.,4,5
Sandor Clegane, Go on!,4,5
Arya Stark,([lies down] The Hound.,4,5
Jon Snow, We lost four brothers?,4,5
Eddison Tollett, Five.,4,5
Grenn, [stares at Locke's horribly broken neck] What in Seven Hells could do that to a man?,4,5
Jon Snow, I count ten dead mutineers. Locke said there were eleven of them.,4,5
Eddison Tollett, Where's Rast?,4,5
Watchman, Here's another!,4,5
Grenn, [glances up and sees Ghost appear at the gate] Jon?,4,5
Jon Snow," [smiles] Where in Seven Hells?! Come here! I've missed you, boy.",4,5
Eddison Tollett, [indicates Craster's surviving daughter-wives] What should we do with this lot?,4,5
Jon Snow," It's not safe for you out here on your own. Mance Rayder has an army heading this way, and there's worse out there than Mance. Come with us to Castle Black. We can find you work, keep you safe.",4,5
Craster's first wife," Meaning all respect, Ser Crow. Craster beat us, and worse. Your brother Crows beat us, and worse. We'll find our own way.",4,5
Jon Snow, You want to stay here? In Craster's Keep?,4,5
Craster's first wife, [looks up at the hall and spits] Burn it to the ground and all the dead with it.,4,5
Tycho Nestoris," Welcome to the Iron Bank. Please...sit. What can we do for you, Lord Stannis?",4,6
Davos Seaworth," This is Stannis of the House Baratheon, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, and Protector of the Realm!",4,6
Tycho Nestoris," The Iron Throne is currently occupied by Tommen of the House Baratheon, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.",4,6
Stannis Baratheon," He shares no blood with me. He was a bastard born of incest, as was his brother before him.",4,6
Tycho Nestoris," Yes, we've heard this story.",4,6
Stannis Baratheon, It's not a story! It's the truth!,4,6
Tycho Nestoris," The King's grandfather tells a different story: a story about a jealous uncle, whose attempts to usurp the throne from the rightful King cost the Seven Kingdoms dearly, in blood...and gold.",4,6
Tycho Nestoris," The King's grandfather tells a different story: a story about a jealous uncle, whose attempts to usurp the throne from the rightful King cost the Seven Kingdoms dearly, in blood...and gold.",4,6
Stannis Baratheon, Gold you loaned him.,4,6
Tycho Nestoris, And you feel your blood gives you a claim on our gold?,4,6
Stannis Baratheon, More than any man living.,4,6
Tycho Nestoris," Across the Narrow Sea, your books are filled with words like ""Usurper"", ""Madman"" and ""blood right"". Here, our books are filled with numbers. We prefer the stories they tell, more plain, less... open to interpretation. How many fighting men remain loyal to you?",4,6
Stannis Baratheon, Four thousand.,4,6
Tycho Nestoris," And how many ships do you have? The ones still afloat, Ser Davos, not at the bottom of Blackwater Bay.",4,6
Davos Seaworth, Thirty-two.,4,6
Tycho Nestoris," And, how much wheat and barley and beef and pork do you produce on Dragonstone to feed your... four thousand men, on your thirty-two ships?",4,6
Stannis Baratheon, None.,4,6
Tycho Nestoris," You can see why these numbers seem unlikely to add up to a happy ending, from our perspective. I'm afraid we must...respectfully decline your request. But we thank you for paying us the honor of your visit. (Stannis glares at Davos; they stand up. Stannis moves away, but Davos steps towards the table)",4,6
Davos Seaworth, My lord-,4,6
Tycho Nestoris," I'm not a lord, Ser Davos Seaworth. You would not be either here. In Braavos, thieves are not rewarded with titles.",4,6
Davos Seaworth," Well, strictly speaking, I didn't do the thieving. That would be the pirates. I just moved what they stole from one place to another. [shows his mutilated hand] This is the payment that was demanded by King Stannis for my crimes. I consider it an honest accounting. He's an honest man and he's your best chance to get back the money you've sunk into Westeros. Which is a lot, I imagine. Wars are expensive.",4,6
Tycho Nestoris, The war is over.,4,6
Davos Seaworth," As long as Stannis lives, the war is not over. Who's the real power in King's Landing?",4,6
Tycho Nestoris, Ser Davos.,4,6
Davos Seaworth, Humor me.,4,6
Tycho Nestoris, Tywin Lannister.,4,6
Davos Seaworth, How old is Tywin Lannister?,4,6
Tycho Nestoris, 67.,4,6
Davos Seaworth," 67. And when he dies, who's in command? A half-grown boy, the product of incest? Cersei Lannister, a queen whose people despise her? Jaime Lannister, a man best known for killing the king he was sworn to protect? When Tywin's gone, who do you back?",4,6
Tycho Nestoris, That is a problem for another time.,4,6
Davos Seaworth," Begging your pardon, I think it's a problem for now. There's only one reliable leader left in Westeros. Stannis. He's got the birthright. He's in his prime. He's a tried and tested battle commander. And he doesn't just talk about paying people back, he does it.",4,6
Bolton guard, [about Theon/Reek] Last cage on the right!,4,6
Yara Greyjoy, Thank you. [she slits his throat with her hatchet] We're going home.,4,6
Theon Greyjoy, No! [backs away from her as she opens the door],4,6
Yara Greyjoy," It's all right! It's me,Yara.",4,6
Theon Greyjoy, You can't trick me! Tell him! Tell him you couldn't trick me!,4,6
Yara Greyjoy," I'm not tricking you, Theon! I'm saving you.",4,6
Theon Greyjoy, Not Theon! Reek! Reek! My name's Reek!,4,6
Bolton guards, They're here!,4,6
Greyjoy bannerman," If they catch us in here, we're trapped!",4,6
Yara Greyjoy, Help me with him!,4,6
Theon Greyjoy," [crying hysterically] No, you can't! You can't!",4,6
Yara Greyjoy, You're Theon Greyjoy!,4,6
Theon Greyjoy," No! I've never been him! Please- I'm Reek, good Reek, I've always been Reek!",4,6
Ramsay Snow, [entering the kennels] This is turning into a lovely evening.,4,6
Yara Greyjoy," Aaargh! Theon! Give me my brother back, and no more of your men will die.",4,6
Ramsay Snow," You've got bigger balls than he ever did. But, with those... big balls of yours... [grins as he unlocks the hounds' cages] How fast can you run?",4,6
Oberyn Martell," These meetings aren't always going to be this early, are they? I was up late last night. So, does this mean I am a master of something now? Coins, ships?",4,6
Mace Tyrell, Lord Tywin and I already determined that I shall be the Master of Ships long before you...,4,6
Mace Tyrell," Lord Tywin, it's a great honor to have been granted a seat on this council. I...",4,6
Tywin Lannister, The trial begins this afternoon. We only have the morning for affairs of state. Shall we begin?,4,6
Varys," Sandor Clegane has been spotted in the Riverlands, my lord.",4,6
Cersei Lannister, A coward and a traitor.,4,6
Varys," My birds tell me the Hound slaughtered five of our soldiers. I believe the phrase ""Fuck the King"" was uttered.",4,6
Grand Maester Pycelle, Disgraceful.,4,6
Tywin Lannister, What would it take to make the common soldier stupid enough to try his luck with the Hound?,4,6
Varys, 10 Silver stags seems a generous bounty.,4,6
Tywin Lannister, Make it 100. What else?,4,6
Varys," More whispers from the east, my lord.",4,6
Tywin Lannister, The Targaryen girl?,4,6
Varys, Daenerys has taken up residence in Meereen. She has conquered the city and rules as its queen.,4,6
Cersei Lannister, Conquered with what?,4,6
Varys," She commands an army of Unsullied, my queen. Some 8,000 strong. She has a company of sellswords, the Second Sons. She has two knights advising her. Jorah Mormont and Barristan Selmy. And she has three dragons.",4,6
Cersei Lannister, Baby dragons.,4,6
Varys," Larger every year, Your Grace.",4,6
Grand Maester Pycelle, Mormont is spying on her for us.,4,6
Varys," No longer. He appears to be fully devoted to her. As for Ser Barristan, it would seem he took his dismissal from the Kingsguard a bit harder than anticipated.",4,6
Cersei Lannister, He's an old man. He wasn't fit to protect my son.,4,6
Tywin Lannister, Joffrey didn't die on his watch. Dismissing him was as insulting as it was stupid.,4,6
Cersei Lannister," Don't tell me you're worried about a child, halfway across the world.",4,6
Varys," A child with two seasoned warriors counseling her... and a powerful army at her back, Your Grace.",4,6
Oberyn Martell, Lord Varys is right. I have been to Essos and seen the Unsullied firsthand. They are very impressive on the battlefield. Less so in the bedroom.,4,6
Tywin Lannister, Dragons haven't won a war in 300 years. Armies win them all the time. She must be dealt with.,4,6
Pycelle," How, my lord? By force?",4,6
Tywin Lannister," Eventually, if it comes to that. Can your little birds find their way into Mereen?",4,6
Varys," Most certainly, my Lord Hand.",4,6
Jaime Lannister, You'd condemn your own son to death?,4,6
Tywin Lannister, I've condemned no one. The trial is not over.,4,6
Jaime Lannister," This isn't a trial, it's a farce! Cersei has manipulated everything and you know it!",4,6
Tywin Lannister, I know nothing of the sort.,4,6
Jaime Lannister, You've always hated Tyrion!,4,6
Tywin Lannister, He killed his king-,4,6
Jaime Lannister, As did I! Do you know the last order the Mad King gave me? To bring him your head! [Tywin looks surprised] I saved your life so you could murder my brother?,4,6
Tywin Lannister," It won't be murder, it will be justice.",4,6
Jaime Lannister, Justice?!,4,6
Tywin Lannister," I'm performing my sworn duty as Hand of the King. If Tyrion is found guilty, he will be punished accordingly.",4,6
Jaime Lannister, He'll be executed.,4,6
Tywin Lannister," No, he'll be punished accordingly!",4,6
Jaime Lannister," Once, you said family is what lives on. All that lives on. You told me about a dynasty that would last 1000 years. What happens to your dynasty when Tyrion dies? I'm a Kingsguard, forbidden by oath to carry on the family line.",4,6
Tywin Lannister, I'm well aware of your oath.,4,6
Jaime Lannister, What happens to your name? Who carries the lion banner into future battles? Your nephews? Lancel Lannister? Others whose names I don't even remember?,4,6
Tywin Lannister, What happens to my dynasty if I spare the life of my grandson's killer?,4,6
Jaime Lannister," It survives...through me. [Tywin looks shocked] I'll leave the Kingsguard, I'll take my place as your son and heir if you let Tyrion live.",4,6
Tywin Lannister," Done. [Jaime is stunned] When the testimony is concluded and the guilty verdict rendered, Tyrion will be given the chance to speak. He'll plead for mercy, I'll allow him to join the Night's Watch. In three days times, he'll depart for Castle Black and live out his days at the Wall. You'll remove your white cloak immediately. You will leave King's Landing to assume your rightful place at Casterly Rock. You will marry a suitable woman, and father children named ""Lannister"". And you'll never turn your back on your family again.",4,6
Jaime Lannister, You have my word.,4,6
Tywin Lannister, And you have mine.,4,6
Tyrion Lannister, [after Shae testifies against him] Father... I wish to confess. I wish to confess.,4,6
Tywin Lannister, You wish to confess?,4,6
Tyrion Lannister, [to the audience of the trial] I saved you. I saved this city and all your worthless lives! I should have let Stannis kill you all!,4,6
Tywin Lannister, Tyrion! Do you wish to confess?,4,6
Tyrion Lannister, Yes... Father. I'm guilty. Guilty! Is that what you want to hear?,4,6
Tywin Lannister, You admit you've poisoned the King?,4,6
Tyrion Lannister," No. Of that, I'm innocent. I'm guilty of a far more monstrous crime. I'm guilty of being a dwarf!",4,6
Tywin Lannister, [exasperated] You are not on trial for being a dwarf.,4,6
Tyrion Lannister," Oh, yes I am! I've been on trial for that my entire life!",4,6
Tywin Lannister, Have you nothing to say on your defense?,4,6
Tyrion Lannister," Nothing but this: I did not do it. I did not kill Joffrey, but I WISH THAT I HAD! [addressing Cersei] Watching your vicious bastard die gave me more relief than a thousand lying whores! [Tyrion glares at Cersei and Shae, then turns to the crowd] I wish I was the monster you think I am. I wish I had enough poison for the whole pack of you. I would gladly give my life to WATCH YOU ALL SWALLOW IT!",4,6
Tyrion Lannister," Nothing but this: I did not do it. I did not kill Joffrey, but I WISH THAT I HAD! [addressing Cersei] Watching your vicious bastard die gave me more relief than a thousand lying whores! [Tyrion glares at Cersei and Shae, then turns to the crowd] I wish I was the monster you think I am. I wish I had enough poison for the whole pack of you. I would gladly give my life to WATCH YOU ALL SWALLOW IT!",4,6
Tywin Lannister," Ser Meryn! Ser Meryn, escort the prisoner back to his cell!",4,6
Tyrion Lannister," I will NOT give my life for Joffrey's murder, and I know I'll get no justice here, so I will let the gods decide my fate. I demand a trial by combat.",4,6
Rorge, There's a price on your head.,4,7
Sandor Clegane," Yes, that's what the King does when you tell him to fuck off.",4,7
Rorge," The King's dead. He drank poisoned wine at his own wedding. The bounty on you is for killing Lannister soldiers, a hundred silver stags.",4,7
Sandor Clegane," And you thought you were going to collect it? Didn't think very hard, did you?",4,7
Arya Stark," You were Yoren's prisoners, when he was taking me to the Wall. He told me he'd fuck me bloody with a stick.",4,7
Sandor Clegane, [to Rorge] This day's really not working out the way you planned. [to Arya] He on your little list?,4,7
Arya Stark, He can't be. I don't know his name.,4,7
Sandor Clegane, What's your name?,4,7
Rorge, Rorge.,4,7
Arya Stark, Thank you. [draws Needle and stabs Rorge through the heart],4,7
Sandor Clegane, You're learning.,4,7
Bronn, My lord. [makes a mocking bow],4,7
Tyrion Lannister, You have new clothes.,4,7
Bronn," You like them, eh? Gloves are doeskin, softer than a virgin's thighs.",4,7
Tyrion Lannister, I sent for you days ago.,4,7
Bronn, I've been a bit busy.,4,7
Tyrion Lannister, Doing what?!,4,7
Bronn, My lonesome bachelor days are over. I'm to wed Lollys Stokeworth.,4,7
Tyrion Lannister, Lollys Stokeworth? She doesn't strike me as your sort of girl.,4,7
Bronn, I wouldn't say I had a single sort of girl.,4,7
Tyrion Lannister, She's dim-witted!,4,7
Bronn," If I wanted wits, I'd marry you.",4,7
Tyrion Lannister," When my sister arranged this love match, did she mention that Lollys has an older sister?",4,7
Bronn," Falyse. Aye, I did know about the older sister.",4,7
Tyrion Lannister, And you do understand the rules of inheritance?,4,7
Bronn, Falyse is forty and barren.,4,7
Tyrion Lannister, She still gets Castle Stokeworth when her father dies.,4,7
Bronn," [nods] She does...unless she happens to perish before her father, then Lollys gets the castle. What? Ladies fall from their horse and snap their pretty necks all the time.",4,7
Tyrion Lannister, You and my sister deserve each other. Why did you bother to come here?,4,7
Bronn," You once said if anyone ever asked me to sell you out, you'd double their price.",4,7
Tyrion Lannister, Is it two wives you want or two castles?!,4,7
Bronn," One of each would do... but if you want me to kill the Mountain for you, it'd better be a damn big castle.",4,7
Tyrion Lannister," I'm a bit short on castles at the moment, but I can offer you gold and gratitude.",4,7
Bronn, I have gold. What can I buy with gratitude?,4,7
Tyrion Lannister, You might be surprised. A Lannister always pays his debts.,4,7
Bronn, Your sister's a Lannister too.,4,7
Tyrion Lannister," My wife is heir to Winterfell. If I emerge from this with my head still on my shoulders, I may one day rule the North in her name. I could carve you out a big piece of it.",4,7
Bronn," If and may and could. It's bloody cold up north. Lollys is soft and warm and close. If I gave you the choice between fucking Lollys and fighting the Mountain, you'd have your britches down and your cock up before I could blink!",4,7
Tyrion Lannister, Does he frighten you so much?!,4,7
Bronn," I'd be a bloody fool if he didn't frighten me. He's freakish big and freakish strong, and quicker than you'd expect for a man of that size. Maybe I could take him, dance around until he's so tired from hacking at me he dropped his sword, get him off his feet somehow...but one misstep and I'm dead. Why should I risk it?",4,7
Tyrion Lannister, Because you're my friend.,4,7
Bronn," Aye, I'm your friend...and when have you ever risked your life for me? I like you, pampered little shit that you are. I just...like myself more.",4,7
Tyrion Lannister, I understand.,4,7
Bronn, I'm sorry it has to be this way.,4,7
Tyrion Lannister, Why are you sorry? Because you're an evil bastard with no conscience and no heart? That's what I liked about you in the first place. [they shake hands for the last time],4,7
Bronn, We had some good days together.,4,7
Tyrion Lannister," Yes, we did.",4,7
Bronn, What will you do?,4,7
Tyrion Lannister, I suppose I'll have to kill the Mountain myself. Won't that make for a great song?,4,7
Bronn, I hope to hear them sing it one day.,4,7
Jorah Mormont, Daario Naharis killed his captains and dumped their heads at your feet when he grew tired of their commands. How could you ever have faith in a man like that?,4,7
Daenerys Targaryen, I could never have faith in a man like Daario. That's why I've sent him and the Second Sons to retake Yunkai.,4,7
Jorah Mormont, You have?,4,7
Daenerys Targaryen, I have.,4,7
Jorah Mormont," Without you there to rule, Khaleesi, I fear the masters will simply bide their time, wait for the invaders to leave and reassert control.",4,7
Daenerys Targaryen, That is why I've ordered Daario to execute every master in Yunkai. The masters tear babies from their mothers' arms. They mutilate little boys by the thousands. They train little girls in the art of pleasuring old men.,4,7
Jorah Mormont," They treat men like beasts, as you said yourself. Herding the masters into pens and slaughtering them by the thousands is also treating men like beasts. The slaves you freed, brutality is all they've ever known. If you want them to know something else, you'll have to show it to them.",4,7
Daenerys Targaryen, And repay the slavers with what? Kindness? A fine? A stern warning?,4,7
Jorah Mormont," It's tempting to see your enemies as evil, all of them, but there's good and evil on both sides in every war ever fought.",4,7
Daenerys Targaryen, Let the priests argue over good and evil. Slavery is real. I can end it. I will end it. And I will end those behind it.,4,7
Jorah Mormont," I sold men into slavery, Khaleesi.",4,7
Daenerys Targaryen, And now you are helping me show them to freedom.,4,7
Jorah Mormont, I wouldn't be here to help you if Ned Stark had done to me what you want to do to the masters of Yunkai.,4,7
Daenerys Targaryen, The man who came to me the other day about burying his father.,4,7
Jorah Mormont, Hizdahr zo Loraq?,4,7
Daenerys Targaryen," He will accompany the Second Sons and serve as my ambassador to Yunkai. He will tell the masters what has happened in Meereen. He will explain the choice they have before them. They can live in my new world or they can die in their old one. Well, go and catch Daario before he leaves. Tell him I changed my mind.",4,7
Jorah Mormont," Yes, Khaleesi.",4,7
Daenerys Targaryen, No. Tell him you changed my mind.,4,7
Tyrion Lannister, I imagined you'd be back at the brothel at this hour.,4,7
Oberyn Martell, I did spend some time with an absolutely stunning blonde the other day.,4,7
Tyrion Lannister," Mm, do tell. I've got every kind of filth down here except the kind I like.",4,7
Oberyn Martell," Your sister, actually.",4,7
Tyrion Lannister, Oh.,4,7
Oberyn Martell, Cersei approached me. We spoke a great deal about her daughter. How worried your sister is about her. She was trying very hard to pretend she had not come to sway me against you. I think she may have even believed it herself.,4,7
Tyrion Lannister, Making honest feelings do dishonest work is one of her many gifts.,4,7
Oberyn Martell, It was difficult for her to hide her true intentions. It is rare to meet a Lannister who shares my enthusiasm for dead Lannisters. She desperately wants to see you killed.,4,7
Tyrion Lannister, She didn't need to bother you. It looks as though I've taken care of that myself. The joy she will feel when my head leaves my neck... she's wanted this for a long time.,4,7
Oberyn Martell," Yes, I know. We met, you and I. Many years ago.",4,7
Tyrion Lannister, I think I would have remembered that.,4,7
Oberyn Martell," Unlikely. You had just been born. Our father brought me and my sister Elia with him, on a visit to Casterly Rock; my first time away from Dorne. I didn't like anything about the Rock. Not the food, not the weather, not your accents. Nothing. But the biggest disappointment... you.",4,7
Tyrion Lannister, You and my family have more in common than you might admit.,4,7
Oberyn Martell," The whole way from Dorne, all anyone talked about was the monster that had been born to Tywin Lannister. A head twice the size of his body, a tail between his legs, claws, one red eye, the privates of both a girl and a boy.",4,7
Tyrion Lannister, That would have made things so much easier.,4,7
Oberyn Martell," When we met your sister, she promised she would show you to us. Every day, we would ask; every day, she would say, ""Soon."" Then, she and your brother took us to your nursery and... she unveiled the freak. Your head was a bit large, your arms and legs were a bit small, but no claw. No red eye. No tail between your legs, just a tiny pink cock. We didn't try to hide our disappointment. ""That's not a monster,"" I told Cersei. ""That's just a baby."" And she said, ""He killed my mother."" And she pinched your little cock so hard, I thought she might pull it off. Until your brother made her stop. ""It doesn't matter,"" she told us. ""Everyone says he will die soon. I hope they are right. He should not have lived this long.""",4,7
Tyrion Lannister," Well... sooner or later, Cersei always gets what she wants.",4,7
Oberyn Martell," And what about what I want? Justice... for my sister, and for her children.",4,7
Tyrion Lannister," If you want justice, you've come to the wrong place.",4,7
Oberyn Martell," I disagree. I've come to the perfect place. I want to bring those who have wronged me to justice. And, all those who have wronged me are right here. I will begin with Ser Gregor Clegane, who killed my sister's children and then raped her with their blood still on his hands before killing her, too. I will be your champion.",4,7
Sansa Stark," You wanted to see me, Aunt Lysa?",4,7
Lysa Arryn," Come here, Sansa. Do you know how far the fall is?",4,7
Sansa Stark, No.,4,7
Lysa Arryn," Neither do I, precisely. Hundreds of feet. It's fascinating what happens to bodies when they hit the rocks from such a height. The impact breaks them right apart. Like eggs dropped on the floor. Sometimes pieces remain intact. You'll find the head sitting on its own. Every hair in place. Blue eyes staring at nothing. [pause] I know what you did.",4,7
Sansa Stark," I'm so sorry, Aunt Lysa. I never should have hit Robin, I know it. I promise it won't happen...",4,7
Lysa Arryn," Don't be coy with me, you little whore. You kissed him. You kissed Petyr.",4,7
Sansa Stark, I didn't. You don't understand.,4,7
Lysa Arryn, I saw you. You can't lie to me because I saw it with my own eyes.,4,7
Sansa Stark, He kissed me. I pulled away.,4,7
Lysa Arryn," Liar! [grabs Sansa by her hair and hold her over the Moon Door] Whore! He is mine! My father, my husband, my sister, they all stood between us and now they're all dead. That's what happens to people who stand between Petyr and me. Look down! Look down! Look down! Look down!",4,7
Petyr Baelish, [entering] Lysa! Let her go.,4,7
Lysa Arryn, You want her? This empty-headed child?,4,7
Petyr Baelish, Let her go.,4,7
Lysa Arryn, She's just like her mother. She'll never love you. I lied for you. I killed for you. Why did you bring her here? Why?,4,7
Petyr Baelish," I'll send her away. I swear on my life. I swear to all the gods. Let her go, Lysa.",4,7
Petyr Baelish," Oh, my sweet wife. My sweet, silly wife. I have only loved one woman... only one, my entire life. [Lysa smiles] Your sister.",4,7
MAN 1, Here we are.,4,8
MAN 2, The Rains of Castamere!,4,8
MOLE'S TOWN WHORE," You fucking dick! Same wrong guess every fucking time. Listen, ya cunt.",4,8
MAN 3," Oh, The Bear and the Maiden Fair!",4,8
MOLE'S TOWN WHORE," There's a man with an ear. Too bad you've got a hangnail for a cock. First time I saw you with your britches down, I thought you were a eunuch! You seen it girls. Like a baby snail peekin' out of his shell. *laughs and walks toward Gilly* *to Gilly* Your baby was crying this morning. It waked me up. You hear me?",4,8
GILLY, Yes.,4,8
MOLE'S TOWN WHORE," Well, what are you going to say?",4,8
GILLY, I'm sorry it woke you up.,4,8
MOLE'S TOWN WHORE," I don't care if you're sorry. Keep that baby quiet, or I will.",4,8
GILLY, Don't you ever touch him.,4,8
MOLE'S TOWN WHORE," Hehehe, little Wildling bitch. You should've stayed with your own kind. *an owl hoots in the distance* Are you listening to me?",4,8
GILLY, Shut your mouth.,4,8
MOLE'S TOWN WHORE, What? It's just an owl you dumb bitch.,4,8
GILLY, No it's not.,4,8
CUT TO, CASTLE BLACK,4,8
SAM, I should never have left her there.,4,8
JON, You couldn't have known.,4,8
SAM, Of course I could've known. They were raiding the villages close by.,4,8
GRENN, And we just cower in here while they slaughter our brothers?,4,8
ED, Our brothers had orders to stay at Castle Black.,4,8
GRENN," Oh, so it's alright then?! Black Jack and Kegs and Mully chopped to pieces 'cause they broke the rules?!",4,8
ED, I didn't say it was alright! I'm sayin' they shouldn't have been there.,4,8
GRENN, We pledged to guard the realms of men.,4,8
SAM, She's dead because of me.,4,8
GRENN, We can't even guard Mole's Town.,4,8
JON," We can't go after them, you know that. That's what they want.",4,8
SAM, Little Same. As if I'd cut their throats myself.,4,8
PYP," Maybe she managed to hide herself. I thought one of you was dead, you went North with Mormont and no one came back. Not for ages. But then you did.",4,8
ED, She survived Craster and he was the worst shit I've ever met. She survived the long march to the wall. She survived a white walker for fuck's sake. She might've got out.,4,8
SAM, She might have.,4,8
JON," If they hit Mole's Town, then we're next. Mance's army must be close.",4,8
ED, A hundred thousand.,4,8
GRENN," And there's what, 5 of us left.",4,8
ED," If you're counting Black Jack, Kegs, and Mully. A hundred and two.",4,8
PYP, How do a hundred and two men stop a thousand?,4,8
ED," Whoever dies last, be a good lad and burn the rest of us. Once I'm done with this world, I don't want to come back.",4,8
CUT TO, MEEREEN,4,8
DANY, You think he was spying on you?,4,8
MISSANDEI," No, not spying.",4,8
DANY, The Dothraki think outsiders are ridiculous taking shame in the naked body. They make love under the stars for the whole Khalasar to see.,4,8
MISSANDEI, Yes your grace.,4,8
DANY, But you are not Dothraki.,4,8
MISSANDEI, No.,4,8
DANY," Well, I don't see why it matters. Grey worm isn't interested, none of the unsullied care what's under our clothes.",4,8
MISSANDEI, He was interested.,4,8
DANY, What?,4,8
MISSANDEI, I believe he was interested.,4,8
DANY," When the slavers castrate the boys, do they take all of it?",4,8
MISSANDEI, All of it?,4,8
DANY, The...the pillar an the stones.,4,8
MISSANDEI," I don't know, your grace.",4,8
DANY, Haven't you ever wondered?,4,8
MISSANDEI," Yes, your grace.",4,8
GREY WORM, Missandei. *in Valyrian* I have come to apologize.,4,8
MISSANDEI, *in Valyrian* You don't need to apologize.,4,8
GREY WORM, *in Valyrian* I hope I didn't frighten you.,4,8
MISSANDEI, *in Valyrian* No.,4,8
GREY WORM," The lessons you give I in Common tongue, these are precious to I.",4,8
MISSANDEI, To me.,4,8
GREY WORM, To me.,4,8
MISSANDEI, I don't remember teaching you the word precious.,4,8
GREY WORM," Jorah the Andal, he teaches I...he teaches me this word.",4,8
MISSANDEI, Do you remember the name you were given at birth?,4,8
GREY WORM, I remember nothing. Only unsullied.,4,8
MISSANDEI," When they cut you, do you remember that?",4,8
MISSANDEI, I'm sorry. I'm sorry they did that to you.,4,8
GREY WORM, Why? Why sorry?,4,8
MISSANDEI, It's a terrible thing to do to a boy.,4,8
GREY WORM," *approaches Missandei* If the masters never cut me, I am never unsullied. I never stand in the Plaza of Pride when Daenerys Stormborn orders us to kill the masters. I never am chosen to lead the unsullied. I never meet Missandei from the Island of Naath. I am sorry I...for today. I am sorry.",4,8
MISSANDEI, *in Valyrian* Grey Worm.,4,8
MISSANDEI, *in Valyrian* I'm glad you saw me.,4,8
GREY WORM, *in Valyrian* So am I.,4,8
CUT TO, MOAT CAILIN,4,8
RAMSAY," Bracken. Mmm, strong. As long as they're in the see. But when you take them out of the water, no bones. They collapse under their proud weight and slum into a heap of nothing. You'd think they'd know that. Unfortunately they're not very bright. What do you tell them?",4,8
THEON," I'm Theon Greyjoy, son of Balon, heir to the Iron Islands.",4,8
RAMSAY, And what are you really?,4,8
THEON, I'm Reek.,4,8
RAMSAY," Are you sure? You do look very much like a lord. Formidable, proud.",4,8
THEON, I'm Reek.,4,8
RAMSAY, Until when?,4,8
THEON, Always. Forever.,4,8
RAMSAY, That's right. Until you're rotting in the ground. Remember what you are and what you're not. Bring me Lord Kenning.,4,8
GUARD 1, *to Theon* No closer. Who are you?,4,8
RALF," I'm Kenning, commander of this garrison. And you say you're Theon Greyjoy?",4,8
THEON, Yes.,4,8
RALF, And why should I believe that?,4,8
THEON, I was born on Pike to Balon Greyjoy. His third and last-living son. I am your prince. I swear it by the drowned god. What is dead may never die.,4,8
EVERYONE, What is dead may never die.,4,8
RALF," And if you were my prince, why are you marching with a Bolton army?",4,8
THEON, Lord Bolton took me captive after Winterfell. He sent me to treat with you in good faith as your fellow Ironborn.,4,8
RALF, And what does Lord Bolton want?,4,8
THEON, You are fading from sickness. You are badly outnumbered and you're hundreds of miles from the sea. Lord Bolton implores you to protect your men and abandon this fortress you can no longer hold. Do this and he will be just and fair with you as he is being with me. The Boltons will give you safe passage to the stony shore.,4,8
RALF, He wants us to surrender?,4,8
THEON," My own father, your king, surrendered years ago to Robert Baratheon. I watched him bend the knee. There was no shame there. He fought with honor, as did you.",4,8
RALF, ...shame fought with honor.,4,8
THEON," I'm sorry, I didn't hear...",4,8
RALF, No shame fought with honor. Only a whipped dog would speak this way. Or a woman. Are you a woman boy?,4,8
THEON, *scared* You don't know.,4,8
RALF, The Ironborn will not surrender.,4,8
THEON, *whispering* Reek. Reek.,4,8
RALF," You go tell your master that, Theon Greyjoy. Or whoever the fuck you are. What in the hell are you muttering?",4,8
THEON, Reek.,4,8
MAN 4," If we yield, we live? Is that what it says on this paper here?",4,8
THEON, Yes. Have your men raise the white flag and open the gates. You're going home.,4,8
RAMSAY," You didn't really think I'd let them go did you? It's falling out of fashion. Fileting. Sad, but true. Traditions are important. Where are we without our history, eh?",4,8
THEON, Yes m'lord. Will we go home now?,4,8
RAMSAY, I believe we will. To our new home.,4,8
CUT TO, THE VALE,4,8
PETYR," A great-grandfather from Braavos, yes. I suppose all of our ancestors came from somewhere else originally.",4,8
LORD ROYCE, Our forebearers settled the Vale thousands of years ago. We've fought off invaders ever since.,4,8
PETYR," The beauty of the Vale is matched only by the nobility of its great families. Lady Arryn often told me that you were her rock, Lord Royce.",4,8
LORD ROYCE," She told me nothing about you, Baelish. But I didn't need to hear from her. Moneylender. Whoremonger. You've been licking Tywin Lannister's boots so long, it's a wonder your tongue's not black.",4,8
PETYR, My lord...,4,8
LORD ROYCE," And when Jon Arryn named you Master of Coin, no one cared. Always been a grubby job. Why not let a grubby man do it? But when I heard you were lurking here, fawning over the Lady Arryn...",4,8
PETYR, Lady Arryn invited me. She and I have been close since childhood.,4,8
LADY ANYA," Yes, we all know how close you were. Lady Arryn's predilections were her own affair. Her death is our affair.",4,8
PETYR, Of course. Her suicide shattered us all.,4,8
LADY ANYA, She was an odd fish. Everyone knew that. But suicide? She adored that boy of hers. I don't see her abandoning him. Not by choice.,4,8
LORD ROYCE," Strange that within days of your arrival, you've married Lady Arryn and she's fallen through the Moon Door.",4,8
PETYR, She was always prone to melancholy. My lady wasn't meant for a world as brutal as ours.,4,8
LORD ROYCE, We were told there was a witness. A girl.,4,8
LADY ANYA," A niece of yours, I believe.",4,8
PETYR," A girl with no learning and scattered wits. I assure you, she would be of no help.",4,8
LORD ROYCE, We'd like to speak with her.,4,8
PETYR, Let me fetch her.,4,8
LADY ANYA, No need. We prefer to hear her testimony unadulterated.,4,8
LADY ANYA," Come closer, child. You have nothing to fear from us or him. Lord Baelish here is your uncle? Your name is Alayne? Perhaps you would feel more comfortable if Lord Baelish left the room.",4,8
PETYR, My lady...,4,8
LADY ANYA, I wasn't asking you.,4,8
SANSA, He can stay.,4,8
LORD ROYCE," Speak up, girl, you're not a damn kitchen mouse. Tell us what you saw.",4,8
SANSA," *to Petyr* I'm sorry, Lord Baelish. I have to tell the truth. *to the council* I'll tell you everything.",4,8
LADY ANYA," Please, Alayne, leave nothing out.",4,8
SANSA," My name is not Alayne. It's Sansa Stark, eldest daughter of Lord Eddard Stark. Lord Royce, we met when you came to Winterfell. You were escorting your son Ser Waymar to the Wall.",4,8
LORD ROYCE," Sansa Stark? You tell lies right to my face, you little worm?",4,8
SANSA," Lord Baelish has told many lies. All to protect me. Since my father was executed, I have been a hostage in King's Landing. A plaything for Joffrey to torture or Queen Cersei to torment. They beat me, they humiliated me, they married me to the Imp. I had no friends in King's Landing...except one. He saved me. Smuggled me away when he had the chance. He knew I'd be safe here in the Eyrie with my own blood, my Aunt Lysa. The Lannisters have friends everywhere. Even the Vale. He made me swear not to tell anyone my true name.",4,8
SER VANCE," Your secret is safe with us, my lady.",4,8
LORD ROYCE, Your father grew up right here in these halls. We hunted together many times. He was a fine man.,4,8
LADY ANYA," Tell us what happened to your aunt, Sansa.",4,8
SANSA," You knew her well, my lords, my lady. You knew she was a troubled woman. She always loved Lord Baelish. She told me herself. From the moment he arrived at the gates of Riverrun, a boy of eight carrying everything he owned in a little sack. She confessed to me she never loved Lord Arryn. She did as her father commanded, as so many of us have. When the gods finally allowed her to be with Lord Baelish, she was so happy. For a time. My aunt was a jealous lady. She was terrified that Lord Baelish didn't love her anymore. That he would abandon her for a younger woman. And then...one day she saw him kiss me.",4,8
LORD ROYCE, Lady Sansa.,4,8
SANSA," It was a peck on the cheek, Lord Royce, nothing more. Lord Baelish is my uncle now, in truth, by marriage. He's always been so kind to me. I was so happy to be here, to be free. All because of him. But my aunt turned on me. She cursed me. Called me a whore. Promised to throw me through the Moon Door. When Lord Baelish tried to calm her, she struck him. She said she didn't want to live anymore. She stood on the edge of that Moon Door. He tried to reason with her. Promised her she was the only one he had ever loved, but she stepped through those doors and she was...*begins sobbing*",4,8
LADY ANYA," Shh. Shh, it's not your fault, sweet girl. It's not your fault.",4,8
LORD ROYCE, You could see it in the way she raised that boy. Feeding him from her own teats when he was 10 years old.,4,8
LADY ANYA, Lord Royce! This is hardly the time.,4,8
LORD ROYCE," Apologies, my lady. And to you as well, Baelish. We treated you a bit harshly.",4,8
PETYR," You want justice, Lord Royce. I can hardly complain about that. I want the same.",4,8
LADY ANYA," Not much justice to be meted out in suicide, is there?",4,8
PETYR," For Lysa, no. But for her son? Only 20 years ago, the knights of the Vale rode behind Jon Arryn, Ned Stark, Robert Baratheon. They fought together to overcome the Mad King. And since then, Arryn and Royce, Corbray, Waynwood, all the great houses of the Vale watched from the corner. A timid boy at a tavern brawl.",4,8
LORD ROYCE, Are you questioning our courage?,4,8
PETYR," I want to know which side you're on. Do you support the Lannisters, the house that executed your friend Ned Stark?",4,8
LORD ROYCE, Of course we don't support the damn Lannisters.,4,8
PETYR," No? Catelyn Stark begged her sister for support and Lysa refused. By staying out of the fray, you've allowed Tywin Lannister to destroy his rivals on every compass point. Who stands against him now?",4,8
LADY ANYA," Who would you have us back, Lord Baelish? Robb Stark is dead.",4,8
PETYR," I'd have you back Robin Arryn, Lord of the Vale.",4,8
LADY ANYA, Robin Arryn is a sickly little boy.,4,8
PETYR, And sickly little boys sometimes become powerful men.,4,8
LADY ANYA, More often they die young.,4,8
PETYR," I adored Lysa with all my heart. But she loved her son so much, she became overprotective. He needs to learn how to swing a sword. How to ride a horse.",4,8
LORD ROYCE," Aye, it's time.",4,8
PETYR," Yes, it's time. Time for him to tour the Vale, to visit all the castles in his domain. Time for Robin to leave the nest.",4,8
CUT TO, MEEREEN,4,8
BOY, Ser Barristan.,4,8
SER BARRISTAN, Yes? Who sent you?,4,8
SER JORAH, Ser Barristan.,4,8
SER BARRISTAN, Ser Jorah.,4,8
SER JORAH, Have I forgotten a council meeting?,4,8
SER BARRISTAN, No.,4,8
SER JORAH, What's this?,4,8
SER BARRISTAN, A royal pardon signed by Robert Baratheon. You spied on her.,4,8
SER JORAH, Who gave you this?,4,8
SER BARRISTAN, Does it matter?,4,8
SER JORAH, Have you told her?,4,8
SER BARRISTAN," I wanted to tell you first, man-to-man rather than go behind your back.",4,8
SER JORAH, Let me speak with her in private.,4,8
SER BARRISTAN, You'll never be alone with her again.,4,8
DANY, Why did the usurper pardon you?,4,8
SER JORAH, If we could speak alone.,4,8
DANY," No, speak to me here. Explain it to me.",4,8
SER JORAH," Who do you think sent this to Meereen? Who profits? This is the work of Tywin Lannister. He wants to divide us. If we're fighting each other, we're not fighting him.",4,8
DANY, The pardon was signed the year we met. Why were you pardoned? Unless you're saying this document was forged.,4,8
SER JORAH, It is not forged.,4,8
DANY," Why, then?",4,8
SER JORAH," I sent letters to Varys, the spymaster of King's Landing.",4,8
DANY, What was the content of these letters?,4,8
SER JORAH, Information.,4,8
DANY, What information?,4,8
SER JORAH, When you and Viserys arrived in Pentos. His plan to marry you to Khal Drogo. When you were married. When your brother died.,4,8
DANY, You told him I was carrying Drogo's child?,4,8
SER JORAH, I...,4,8
DANY, Yes or no?,4,8
SER JORAH, Khaleesi.,4,8
DANY, Don't call me that. Did you tell him I was carrying Drogo's child?,4,8
SER JORAH, Yes.,4,8
DANY, That wine merchant tried to poison me because of your information.,4,8
SER JORAH, I stopped you from drinking his wine.,4,8
DANY, Because you knew it was poisoned.,4,8
SER JORAH, I suspected.,4,8
DANY, You betrayed me from the first.,4,8
SER JORAH," Forgive me. I never meant...please, Khaleesi, forgive me.",4,8
DANY, You sold my secrets to the man who killed my father and stole my brother's throne...,4,8
SER JORAH, I have protected you. Fought for you. Killed for you.,4,8
DANY, ...and you want me to forgive you?,4,8
SER JORAH, I have loved you.,4,8
DANY," Love? Love? How can you say that to me? Any other man, and I would have you executed. But you, I do not want you in my city dead or alive. Go back to your masters in King's Landing. Collect your pardon if you can.",4,8
SER JORAH," Daenerys, please.",4,8
DANY," Don't ever presume to touch me again or speak my name. You have until dusk to collect your things and leave this city. If you're found in Meereen past break of day, I'll have your head thrown into Slaver's Bay. Go. Now.",4,8
CUT TO, MOAT CAILIN,4,8
RAMSAY," Moat Cailin is yours, Father.",4,8
LORD BOLTON, Walk with me. Has there been any word from Locke?,4,8
RAMSAY, No.,4,8
RAMSAY," Unimportant. A cripple, a young boy. None of the northern lords have seen them. Dead most likely. Most of the Ironborn have fled the North. Now more will follow, thanks to you. Tell me what you see.",4,8
RAMSAY," Moors, fields, hills.",4,8
RAMSAY, Tell me what you see.,4,8
RAMSAY, Nothing.,4,8
ROOSE," Not nothing. The North. Ride 700 miles that way, you're still in the North. 400 miles that way. 300 miles that way. The North is larger than the other six kingdoms combined. And I am the Warden of the North. The North is mine. Now tell me, what is your name?",4,8
RAMSAY, Ramsay Snow.,4,8
ROOSE," No, not Ramsay Snow. *hands Ramsay a scroll* Open it. From this day until your last day, you are Ramsay Bolton, son of Roose Bolton, Warden of the North.",4,8
RAMSAY," You honor me. I swear I will uphold your name and your tradition. I will be worthy of you, Father, I promise.",4,8
RAMSAY," Come, Reek, I'll be needing a bath.",4,8
CUT TO, THE VALE,4,8
SANSA, Yes?,4,8
PETYR," First time I saw you, you were just a child. A girl from the North come to the capital for the first time. Not a child any longer. Why did you help me?",4,8
SANSA, They would have thrown you through the Moon Door if they found you guilty.,4,8
PETYR, That's not an answer.,4,8
SANSA," If they'd have executed you, what would they have done with me?",4,8
PETYR, I don't know.,4,8
SANSA, Neither do I.,4,8
PETYR, Better to gamble on the man you know than the strangers you don't? And you think you know me?,4,8
SANSA, I know what you want.,4,8
PETYR, Do you?,4,8
CUT TO, OUTSIDE THE VALE,4,8
HOUND," I thought it'd make me happy, but it doesn't. Not really. Nothing makes you happy.",4,8
ARYA, Lots of things make me happy.,4,8
HOUND, Like what?,4,8
ARYA," Killing Polliver, killing Rorge.",4,8
HOUND, So you're sad because you didn't get to kill Joffrey yourself. Is that it?,4,8
ARYA, At least I could have been there to watch. I wanted to see the look in his eyes when he knew it was over.,4,8
HOUND," Aye, nothing in the world beats that look.",4,8
ARYA, You protected him for most of his life. You think you could have saved him?,4,8
HOUND," I wasn't the damn wine taster. Little shit deserved to die, but poison...poison's a woman's weapon. Men kill with steel.",4,8
ARYA, That's your stupid pride talking. It's why you'll never be a great killer. I'd have killed Joffrey with a chicken bone if I had to.,4,8
HOUND, *laughs* I'd pay good money to see that. *grunts and rubs his neck*,4,8
ARYA, You should have let me burn it.,4,8
HOUND, It's a fleabite.,4,8
ARYA, That fleabite's got you walking a lot slower than you used to.,4,8
HOUND," Well, we won't have to walk too much further.",4,8
ARYA, You really think my aunt will pay for me?,4,8
HOUND," Aye, she'll pay.",4,8
ARYA, I've never even met her.,4,8
HOUND," Doesn't matter. You're her blood. Family, honor, all that horseshit. It's all you lords and ladies ever talk about.",4,8
ARYA, I'm not a lady.,4,8
GUARD, Who would pass the Bloody Gate?,4,8
HOUND," The bloody Hound, Sandor Clegane. And his...traveling companion Arya Stark, niece of your lady Lysa Arryn.",4,8
GUARD, Then I offer my condolences. Lady Arryn died. Three days ago.,4,8
CUT TO, THE VALE,4,8
ROBIN," I've never left home before, Uncle Petyr. I'm afraid to leave.",4,8
PETYR, You shouldn't be.,4,8
ROBIN," The Lord of the Vale belongs in the Eyrie, Mother said. She said it's not safe outside.",4,8
PETYR, It wasn't safe for her inside. People die at their dinner tables. They die in their beds. They die squatting over their chamber pots. Everybody dies sooner or later. Don't worry about your death. Worry about your life. Take charge of your life for as long as it lasts. That is what it means to be Lord of the Vale.,4,8
SANSA, Shall we go?,4,8
CUT TO, KING'S LANDING,4,8
TYRION, Wine always helps. I thank you for it. Trial by combat. Deciding a man's guilt or innocence in the eyes of the gods by having two other men hack each other to pieces. Tells you something about the gods. How much longer?,4,8
JAIME, Soon.,4,8
TYRION," Do you think Oberyn has a chance? The Red Viper of Dorne. You don't get a name like that unless you're deadly, right?",4,8
JAIME, I've never seen him fight.,4,8
TYRION," Oh, he's going to die. I'm going to die.",4,8
JAIME, Oberyn believes in himself.,4,8
TYRION, That's putting it mildly. What's the punishment for regicide? Drawing and quartering? Hanging? Breaking at the wheel?,4,8
JAIME, Beheading.,4,8
TYRION," Seems rather ordinary. And he was my nephew as well, so what is that? Fratricide is brothers. Filicide is sons. Nepoticide. That's the one. Matricide, patricide, infanticide, suicide. There's no kind of killing that doesn't have its own word.",4,8
JAIME, Cousins.,4,8
TYRION," Cousins, you're right. There is no word for cousin killing. Well done. Do you remember cousin Orson? Orson Lannister?",4,8
JAIME, Of course. Wet-nurse dropped him on his head. Left him simple.,4,8
TYRION, Simple? Used to sit all day in the garden. Crushing beetles with a rock.,4,8
TOGETHER, Khuu! Khuu! Khuu!,4,8
TYRION, Nothing made him happier.,4,8
JAIME, Nothing made you happier. You'd think being tormented from birth would have given you some affinity for the afflicted.,4,8
TYRION, On the contrary. Laughing at another person's misery was the only thing that made me feel like everyone else.,4,8
JAIME," The joke wore thin, though.",4,8
TYRION, For you. You drifted away.,4,8
JAIME, I had other interests.,4,8
TYRION," Yes, other interests. But I stayed with Orson.",4,8
JAIME, Why?,4,8
TYRION," I was curious. Why was he smashing all those beetles? What did he get out of it? First thing I did was ask him. ""Orson, why are you smashing all those beetles?"" He gave me an answer. ""Smash the beetles. Smash 'em. Khuu! Khuu! Khuu!"" I wasn't deterred. I was the smartest person I knew. Certainly I had the wherewithal to unravel the mysteries that lay at the heart of a moron. So I went to Maester Volarik's library.",4,8
JAIME, Volarik. Tried to touch me once.,4,8
JAIME," Every day around the world, men, women, and children are murdered by the score. Who gives a dusty fuck about a bunch of beetles?",4,8
TYRION," I know, I know. But still, it filled me with dread. Piles and piles of them, years and years of them. How many countless living crawling things smashed and dried out and returned to the dirt? In my dreams I found myself standing on a beach made of beetle husks stretching as far as the eye could see. I woke up crying, weeping for their shattered little bodies. I tried to stop Orson once.",4,8
JAIME, He was twice your size.,4,8
TYRION," He just pushed me aside with a ""khuu"" and kept on smashing. Every day until that mule kicked him in the chest and killed him. *puts the beetle back on the ground* So what do you think? Why did he do it? What was it all about?",4,8
JAIME, I don't know.,4,8
JAIME, Good luck today.,4,8
TYRION, Looks like very light armor.,4,8
OBERYN, I like to move around.,4,8
TYRION, You could at least wear a helmet. You shouldn't drink before a fight.,4,8
OBERYN, You learn this during your years in the fighting pits? I always drink before a fight.,4,8
TYRION, It could get you killed. It could get me killed.,4,8
OBERYN, Today is not the day I die.,4,8
ELLARIA, You're going to fight that?,4,8
OBERYN, I'm going to kill that.,4,8
ELLARIA, He is the biggest man I've ever seen.,4,8
OBERYN, Size does not matter when you are flat on your back.,4,8
TYRION, Thank the gods.,4,8
PYCELL," In the sight of gods and men, we gather to ascertain the guilt or innocence of this...man Tyrion Lannister. May the Mother grant them mercy. May the Father give them such justice as they deserve. And may the Warrior guide the hand of our champion...",4,8
ELLARIA, Don't leave me alone in this world.,4,8
OBERYN, Never.,4,8
OBERYN, Have they told you who I am?,4,8
MOUNTAIN, Some dead man.,4,8
OBERYN, I am the brother of Elia Martell. Do you know why I have come all the way to this stinking shit-pile of a city? For you.,4,8
OBERYN, I'm going to hear you confess before you die. You raped my sister. You murdered her. You killed her children. Say it now and we can make this quick.,4,8
OBERYN, Say it. You raped her. You murdered her. You killed her children.,4,8
OBERYN, You raped her! You murdered her! You killed her children!,4,8
OBERYN, You raped her! You murdered her!,4,8
OBERYN, You killed her children!,4,8
OBERYN," Wait. Are you dying? No, no, no. You can't die yet. You haven't confessed. Say it. Say her name. Elia Martell. You raped her. You killed her children. Elia Martell. Who gave you the order? Who gave you the order?! Say her name! You raped her! You murdered her! You killed her children. Say it. Say her name. Say it!",4,8
MOUNTAIN, Elia Martell. I killed her children. Then I raped her. Then I smashed her head in like this!,4,8
TYWEN," *standing up* The gods have made their will known. Tyrion Lannister, in the name of King Tommen of the House Baratheon, First of His Name, you are hereby sentenced to death.",4,8
Title, The Watchers on the Wall,4,9
SAM, What was she like?,4,9
JON, She...she had red hair.,4,9
SAM, Oh? How big were her feet?,4,9
JON, Well what do you want me to say?,4,9
SAM, I want you to tell me what it was like to have someone. To be with someone. To love someone and have them love you back. We're all gonna die a lot sooner than I'd planned. You're the closest I'll ever get to know it.,4,9
JON, So you and Gilly never-,4,9
SAM, No...she just had a baby! ...and she never offered.,4,9
JON," But if she had, you would've? You'd have broken your vows?",4,9
SAM," The interesting thing is, our vows never specifically forbid intimate relations with women.",4,9
JON, What?,4,9
SAM," ""I shall take no wife"" yes, that's in there, there's no denying that. ""I shall father no children"" it's very specific. But what our vows have to say about other...activities...is open to interpretation.",4,9
JON, I don't think Ser Alliser cares much for interpretation.,4,9
SAM," Anyway, there's nothing for him to interpret. We didn't. So what's it like?",4,9
JON," It's...there's this person, this whole other person. And you're wrapped up in them and they're wrapped up in you and...you...for a little...for a little while you're more than just you, you're...well I don't know, I'm not a bleedin' poet!",4,9
SAM," No, you're really not.",4,9
JON, And what did I get for it? An arrow six inches from my heart.,4,9
SAM, There'll be arrows for all of us soon I imagine.,4,9
JON, There will.,4,9
SAM, They've already done the worst thing to me they could ever do.,4,9
JON," Go get some sleep, Sam. I'll take this watch.",4,9
TORMUND, Did I ever tell you about her? My Sheila?,4,9
YGRITTE, Yes.,4,9
TORMUND," Oh that was a night to remember. Of course, I'd had a good bit to drink *laughs* the fangs were sharp, but she knew how to use them. And she was nice and soft down below. No, she was no ordinary beast. Many's the man who--",4,9
YGRITTE, I know you never fucked a bear. You know you never fucked a bear. Right now I don't wanna think about the bear you never fucked. Right now all I want to think about is each one of these arrows finding its way into a Crow's heart.,4,9
TORMUND, We could be waiting here a while.,4,9
YGRITTE," Good. The longer we wait, the more arrows I'll have. When they came up here, to our land, and put up a big wall and said it was their's. Then they started hunting us down. But this time, we're the one's doing the hunting.",4,9
STYR, You've got a lot to say about killing. Even more words than arrows.,4,9
YGRITTE," Back in those villages I killed just as many of them as you did. More, I reckon.",4,9
STYR, Yes. But none of those were your Crow lover.,4,9
YGRITTE, I probably killed him already.,4,9
STYR, So you've said.,4,9
YGRITTE, And if not. The only thing left of him is gonna be his fun-bits hanging around me neck.,4,9
STYR, And more words. Know what I think you do when you see him? Serve him up a nice juicy slice of ginger minge.,4,9
YGRITTE," What, you been thinkin' about that ginger minge? Wondering what it tastes like?",4,9
STYR, Maybe I have.,4,9
YGRITTE," Jon Snow is mine. *shouting* Anyone else tries to kill him, I'll have an arrow for them. *to Styr* And not one of your bald friends is fast enough to stop me.",4,9
AEMON," And what is it that couldn't wait until morning, Tarly?",4,9
SAM, Maester Aemon. How did you know-,4,9
AEMON, That it was you? Who else but Samwell Tarly would be wasting candles to read in the middle of the night?,4,9
SAM, Let me help you.,4,9
AEMON," Oh, no need. I know my way around this library better than any other place in Castle Black. Thousands of books and no eyes to read them. Old age is a wonderful source of irony if nothing else. But you didn't answer my question, what are you reading?",4,9
SAM, Maester Faull,4,9
AEMON," Ah, the Wildlings. I can assure you that the closest Maester Faull ever got to a Wildling was this very library.",4,9
SAM, But what he says about what they do...it's all true. It's exactly what the survivors of their raids report.,4,9
AEMON, Yes. Imagine the stories Wildlings tell about us! Love is the death of duty. I told that to your friend Jon Snow once. He didn't listen and neither did you. That's why you abandoned your watch atop the wall to come here and read about the things that may have happened to the girl you love.,4,9
SAM, I don't love her.,4,9
AEMON, Yes you do.,4,9
SAM, No.,4,9
AEMON, Yes you do! I heard it in your voice when you first brought her to me. I remember how it sounds! I was in love once.,4,9
SAM, You were?,4,9
AEMON," You can imagine all manner of horrors befalling that poor girl and her child, is it so difficult to imagine that an old person was once, more or less, like you?",4,9
SAM," I'm sorry Maester, I didn't mean it like that.",4,9
AEMON, You know who I was before I came here? What I could've been if I'd only said the word? Of course you do. I met many girls when I was Aemon Targaryen. A future king always does. Some of them were quite forward in their attempts to win my affections. One of them succeeded. I was very young.,4,9
SAM, Who was she?,4,9
AEMON, Ah ha. I could tell you everything about her. Who she was. How we met. The color of her eyes and the shape of her nose. I can see her right in front of me. She's more real than you are. We could spend all night trading tales of lost love. Nothing makes the past a sweeter place to visit than the prospect of imminent death. Go to bed Tarly.,4,9
PYP," I'm sorry, I can't open the gate for nobody. It's orders!",4,9
GILLY," They killed everyone! Everyone but me and my baby. And they're out there. I saw them on the way here, they may have seen me, they may have followed me please!",4,9
PYP," I'm sorry, I can't.",4,9
GILLY," If they find the boy, you don't know what they'll do.",4,9
SAM, Pyp! Open the gate.,4,9
PYP, I can't.,4,9
GILLY," Sam, is that you?!",4,9
SAM, Yes!,4,9
PYP, Thorne gave me strict orders to not open the gate.,4,9
SAM," Oh, Pyp. Open the fucking gate!",4,9
PYP, I've never heard you curse before.,4,9
SAM," Yes, well, best get used to it.",4,9
SAM," Are you alright? Shh, you're alright. Yeah, of course you are my brave little fella.",4,9
GILLY, It was horrible.,4,9
SAM, I'm so so sorry. I didn't know until I got back.,4,9
GILLY," Don't let them send me away, Sam.",4,9
SAM, Never.,4,9
GILLY, I know there's no women allowed.,4,9
SAM," Anyone who tries to throw you out will be having words with me. From now on, wherever you go, I go too.",4,9
ALLISER, Get ready!,4,9
THENN WARG, It's time.,4,9
JANOS, Pick up the pace!,4,9
JON," There we go, boys. That's one. There's two. Come on, let's get the next lot. That's the last of the oil, Ser Alliser.",4,9
ALLISER, A hundred thousand you say?,4,9
JON, Yes sir.,4,9
ALLISER, You can say it if you like. We should've sealed the tunnel while we had the chance like you suggested.,4,9
JON," It was a difficult decision either way, Ser.",4,9
ALLISER," Do you know what leadership means, Lord Snow? It means that the person in charge gets second-guessed by every little twat with a mouth. But if he starts second-guessing himself, that's the end. For him. For the clever little twats. For everyone. This is not the end. Not for us. Not if you lot do your duty for however long it takes to beat them back. And then you get to go on hating me and I get to go on wishing your Wildling whore had finished the job.",4,9
SAM, You'll be safe down here. I'll check on you as soon as I can.,4,9
GILLY, You're leaving me again?,4,9
SAM, I'm not leaving you!,4,9
GILLY, You're going up there and we're staying down here. That's leaving. You said from now on we'd stay together.,4,9
SAM, I...I didn't mean in the same room.,4,9
GILLY, What are you going to do out there?,4,9
SAM, Help my brothers.,4,9
GILLY, How?! You going to fight the Free Folk when they come? They'll kill you. In Molestown they killed everyone.,4,9
SAM, I can't just hide here with you while they're fighting out there.,4,9
GILLY," Why not? You won't matter up there, you will down here.",4,9
SAM," Look. I am a man of the Night's Watch, Gilly. I made a promise to defend The Wall and I have to keep it, because that's what men do.",4,9
GILLY, Promise me you won't die.,4,9
SAM, I promise you I won't die.,4,9
SAM, There's a lot more Wildlings on the other side of the wall than this side. We've got us some weapons and things. This is the perfect place for us to be.,4,9
PYP, I've never thrown a spear before. I've never held a sword with a proper edge. There's no place for me to be. You're not afraid?,4,9
SAM," Of course I'm afraid, there's a band of Wildlings coming to kill us.",4,9
PYP," Well if you're afraid of a band of Wildlings, how in seven hells did you manage to kill a White Walker?",4,9
SAM," I didn't know I was going to kill it, but I had to do something I didn't have any choice, he was going to kill Gilly and take the baby. If someone had asked me my name right then, I wouldn't have known. I wasn't Samwell Tarly anymore. I wasn't a Steward in the Night's Watch or son of Randyll Tarly or any of that. I was nothing at all. And when you're nothing at all, there's no more reason to be afraid.",4,9
PYP, But you're afraid now?,4,9
SAM," Yes, well, I'm not nothing anymore.",4,9
YGRITTE, Most of their men are up top. Didn't count more than twenty down there. Leftovers. They've got a little fat one and a little bony one manning the front.,4,9
STYR, How high are the walls?,4,9
YGRITTE," Well, we'll be up and over before they know what's happened.",4,9
TORMUND, Let's kill some Crows!,4,9
TORMUND, *yells* Come on! *puts out the fire*,4,9
ALLISER," Archers knock, everyone else hold.",4,9
ALLISER, I said knock and hold you cunts! Does knock mean draw?!,4,9
NIGHT'S WATCH, No Ser!,4,9
ALLISER, Does fucking hold mean fucking drop?!,4,9
NIGHT'S WATCH, No Ser!,4,9
ALLISER, You all plan to die here tonight?,4,9
NIGHT'S WATCH, No Ser!,4,9
ALLISER, That's very good to hear. Draw!,4,9
MEMBER 1," Help, down below.",4,9
JANOS, They're attacking the southern gates!,4,9
ALLISER, Now?,4,9
JANOS, Now!,4,9
ALLISER," I'm going down then. Brother Slynt, you have The Wall.",4,9
JANOS, What?!,4,9
ALLISER," What are you fucking waiting for, loose!",4,9
JANOS, You heard the man. Loose!,4,9
TORMUND," You, over there.",4,9
SAM, Did you get one?,4,9
PYP," No. Ah shit, Pyp. Shit. Sam.",4,9
SAM, Yeah?,4,9
PYP, I think we're gonna die.,4,9
SAM, If you keep missing we will.,4,9
ALLISER, Brothers! A hundred generations have defended this castle. We've never fallen before. She will not fall tongiht. Those are Things at our walls. They eat the flesh of the men they kill. Do you want to fill the belly of a Thing tonight?,4,9
NIGHT'S WATCH, No!,4,9
ALLISER," Tonight we fight. And when the sun rises I promise you, Castle Black will stand.",4,9
ALLISER, The Night's Watch will stand.,4,9
ALLISER," With me now! Now, with me!",4,9
JANOS," No discipline. No training. Gang of thieves, that's all this is. I commanded the city watch of King's Landing. Those men obeyed orders.",4,9
JON, We can't just let them attack the gate!,4,9
JANOS," The bars of those gates are four inches of cold, rolled steel.",4,9
JON," Those are giants riding mammoths down there. Do you think your cold, rolled steel's gonna stop them?",4,9
JANOS, No such thing as giants. They're stories for the children.,4,9
GRENN," Brother Slynt! I've just got word that Ser Alliser needs you below. You're the most experienced man he's got, he said he needs ya.",4,9
JANOS, Needed below? Yes. Yes.,4,9
JON, Archers! Knock your arrows! Draw! Loose!,4,9
JON, They won't summit before dawn.,4,9
GRENN, How do you know that?,4,9
JON, Because I've made that claim.,4,9
ED, I think they're in a bigger hurry than you were.,4,9
JON, Knock! Draw! Loose!,4,9
PYP," I got one. Right through the heart, he's dead.",4,9
SAM," Oh, is it over?",4,9
PYP, Huh?,4,9
SAM, Well then. *hands Pyp a loaded crossbow*,4,9
SAM," You're alright. You're alright. I'll get help. Shh, shh. Maester Aemon is coming, he's gonna make it alright.",4,9
JON, Now!,4,9
ED, Now!,4,9
JON," *to Grenn* The outer gate won't hold. Take five men, hold the inner gate.",4,9
GRENN, Alright.,4,9
JON, *grabs Grenn's arm* Hold the gate. If they make it through...,4,9
GRENN," They won't. Come on Hill! And you Cooper! You three, on me! Come on you lazy bastards!",4,9
JON, Oil!,4,9
ED, Oil on the ramp!,4,9
ALLISER, Protect the gate!,4,9
ALLISER, Hold the fucking gate! Hold it!,4,9
SAM, *to Grenn* We need more men down here.,4,9
GRENN, We have to hold the gate.,4,9
SAM, But we need men here.,4,9
GRENN, Tell Jon! He's in command. *to the men behind him* Let's go!,4,9
SAM, *to Olly* Get me to the top! You hear me?!,4,9
SAM," Your name's Olly, right? Listen to me Olly, get me to the top and when we give a signal, bring us back down. Do you hear me?",4,9
SAM," And find a weapon, Olly. Fight them!",4,9
JON, What are you doing up here?,4,9
SAM, The Wildlings are over the walls. Ser Alliser has fallen. The castle walls can't stand much longer.,4,9
JON," Ed. You have The Wall. If they try the mammoths again, drop fire on them. If the climbers get too high, drop the scythe on them.",4,9
JON, Two brothers now fight with me.,4,9
ED," Might as well enjoy our last night, right boys? Light the fuckers up. Knock! Draw! Loose!",4,9
DONNEL, How are we gonna stop that?,4,9
COOPER, We shot twenty-eight arrows in him already.,4,9
GRENN," You heard Jon, we hold the gate.",4,9
DONNEL, Jon Snow's not Lord Commander.,4,9
GRENN, We hold the gate!,4,9
DONNEL, Mother save me. Father save me.,4,9
GRENN," The gods aren't down here. It's the six of us, you hear me?",4,9
DONNEL," No, please.",4,9
GRENN," Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear no crowns",4,9
All TOGETHER," And win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come!",4,9
JON, *to Sam* I don't want you out there.,4,9
SAM, You can't protect me forever. There won't be anywhere to hide if the castle falls.,4,9
JON, I need him more than I need you.,4,9
SAM, We need you boy.,4,9
YGRITTE, Jon Snow.,4,9
JON," No, shh, don't talk.",4,9
YGRITTE, Do you remember that cave?,4,9
YGRITTE, We should've stayed in that cave.,4,9
JON, We'll go back there.,4,9
YGRITTE," You know nothing, Jon Snow.",4,9
ED," Drop the scythe, boys!",4,9
ED, Hoister up!,4,9
ED, They've had enough for one night.,4,9
ED, Don't cheer too loud. They still outnumber us a thousand to one.,4,9
JON," Tormund. It's over, let it end.",4,9
TORMuND, This is how a man ends.,4,9
JON, Put him in chains. We'll question him later.,4,9
TORMUND, I should've thrown you from the top of your wall boy!,4,9
JON," Aye, you should've.",4,9
SAM," Woah! It's me. It's me. I promised you, didn't I?",4,9
SAM, We held them off.,4,9
JON, For one night.,4,9
SAM, This is a great victory.,4,9
JON," Great victory? Mance was testing our defenses. He almost made it through. And he has more giants, he has more mammoths. He has a thousand times as many men. They'll hit us again tonight. Maybe we can hold them off for a day or two, but we can never beat them.",4,9
SAM, Where are you going?,4,9
JON, I'm going to find Mance.,4,9
SAM, To...you can't do that. No one gave you any orders.,4,9
JON," Who's left to give orders? The Wildling army is only an army because of Mance. He united a hundred warring tribes. Without Mance they lose their leader. They lose their purpose, they go back to fighting each other, scatter back to their home.",4,9
SAM, Without Mance? You're going to kill him?,4,9
JON, I'm going to try.,4,9
SAM," They'll never let you within a hundred yards of him. And if you did, even if you managed to kill him.",4,9
JON, He'll kill me. If I don't go he'll kill me anyway. They'll kill the rest of us too.,4,9
SAM, He won't just kill ya. They'll boil you. They'll filet you. They'll make it last days!,4,9
JON, You're right. It's a bad plan. What's your plan?,4,9
JON," They held the gate. Get some brothers down here to help you. You need to burn the bodies. Raise the outer gate, then lower it again as soon as I'm out.",4,9
SAM, What are you doing?,4,9
JON, I promised Jeor I'd never lose it again. *he hands the sword to Sam* In case I don't come back.,4,9
SAM, Jon. Come back.,4,9
Title, The Children,4,10
MANCE, You're wearing a black cloak again.,4,10
JON, I've been sent to negotiate with you.,4,10
MANCE," It appears my trusting nature got the better of me. It's happened before. I was hoping your loyalty was real when you pledged yourself to us, Jon Snow, truly I was.",4,10
JON," The Halfhand ordered me to join your army and bring back whatever information I could to Castle Black. He made me kill him so you'd trust me. I was loyal, to him and to my Night's Watch vows.",4,10
MANCE," All of your vows? She wasn't enough to turn ya, eh? Were you enough to turn her?",4,10
JON, She put three arrows in me when I escaped.,4,10
MANCE, Did you see her again at Castle Black?,4,10
JON, Yes.,4,10
MANCE, And?,4,10
JON, She's dead.,4,10
MANCE, Your doing?,4,10
JON, No.,4,10

MANCE, Ygritte.,4,10
JON, Ygritte.,4,10
JON, That's not wine.,4,10
MANCE," No, it's a proper Northern drink, Jon Snow. You did well. Fought hard. Killed some of our strongest men. One of our giants went into your tunnel and never came out again. Mag the Mighty.",4,10
JON, He's dead. He killed my friend Grenn.,4,10
MANCE, He was their king. Last of a bloodline that stretches back before the First Men.,4,10
JON, Grenn came from a farm.,4,10
MANCE, Mag and Grenn.,4,10
JON, Grenn and Mag.,4,10
MANCE," Kullback, could I trouble you for something to eat? I don't imagine our guest has eaten anything in quite some time. So. You're here to strike a bargain?",4,10
JON, Turn your army around and go home.,4,10
MANCE, You know I know you're low on arrows. You're low on oil. You're low on men. How many are left? 50?,4,10
JON, I told Tormund and Orell. We have more than a thousand men.,4,10
MANCE," I showed you everything I had. The whole army, a hundred thousand strong, and what did you do? You fired on us with everything you had. It wasn't much. Soon as I saw that I sent four hundred men to climb the wall. An unmanned stretch five miles west of here. A lot of them will die climbing, but most of them will be over by the end of the day. This is me being honest with you, Jon Snow, which is more than you've ever done for me. My people have bled enough. We're not here to conquer, we're here to hide behind your wall just like you. We need your tunnel. Now we both know that winter is coming and if my people aren't south of the wall when it comes in earnest, we'll all end up worse than dead. Wanna strike a bargain with me? Here's a bargain. You go back, you open the gates to us and I swear to you that no one else will die. Refuse and we'll kill every last man in Castle Black.",4,10
MANCE," Ah! Oh, that's why you're here. I reckon you could do it before any of them could stop ya. They'd kill you of course, they'd kill ya slow, but ya knew that when you came in here. Are you capable of that, Jon Snow? Killing a man in his own tent when he's just offered ya peace? Is that what the Night's Watch is? Is that what you are?",4,10
MANCE, You attacking us?,4,10
JON," No, it's like you said, we don't have the men.",4,10
MANCE, Hold! To me. To me.,4,10

STANNIS, You're the king beyond the wall?,4,10
STANNIS, You know who I am?,4,10

DAVOS," This is Stannis Baratheon, the one true king of the seven kingdoms.",4,10
MANCE, We're not in the seven kingdoms and you're not dressed for this weather.,4,10
STANNIS, It is customary to kneel when surrendering to a king.,4,10
MANCE, We do not kneel.,4,10
STANNIS," I'll have thousands of your men in chains by nightfall, I'll have nowhere to put them and nothing to feed them. I'm not here to slaughter beat dogs. Their fate depends on their king.",4,10
MANCE," All the same, we do not kneel.",4,10
STANNIS, Take these men away.,4,10
DAVOS, What are men of the Night's Watch doing in a Wildling camp?,4,10
JON, I was sent to discuss terms with the king beyond the wall.,4,10
DAVOS, You're speaking to the one true king boy. You'll address him as your grace.,4,10
JON," I know he's the king. My father died for him. My name is Jon Snow, your grace. I'm Ned Stark's son.",4,10
STANNIS, Your father was an honorable man.,4,10
JON," He was, your grace.",4,10
STANNIS, What do you think he'd have done with him?,4,10
JON," I was this man's prisoner once. He could've tortured me, he could've killed me, but he spared my life. I think my father would've taken him prisoner, listened to what he had to say.",4,10
STANNIS, Very well. *to Davos* Take him.,4,10

QYBURN," It is, yes, manticore.",4,10
PYCELLE," I've read a good deal about it. It's a horrible poison, usually Mantari in origin. Oh! Yes, yes. There's nothing to be done.",4,10
QYBURN, Yes there is.,4,10
PYCELLE, May I ask what you think you're doing?,4,10
QYBURN, Saving him.,4,10
PYCELLE," Your grace. I wish it were otherwise, but Ser Gregor is beyond saving. Well, well beyond. This man is not even a Maester, let alone Grand Maester.",4,10
QYBURN, That's for the best. No Maester knows how to save him.,4,10
PYCELLE," That is exactly the sort of arrogance that had him expelled from the citadel, your grace. His curiosity was deemed dangerous and unnatural. Rightly so in my opinion.",4,10
CERSEI," You're dismissed, Grand Maester.",4,10
PYCELLE, Your grace. This is my laboratory!,4,10
CERSEI, Not anymore.,4,10
CERSEI, You can save him?,4,10

TYWIN," Not another word. We've been over this, the matter's closed.",4,10
CERSEI, I'm opening it again.,4,10
TYWIN, You are betrothed to Loras Tyrell. Still betrothed to Loras Tyrell and you will marry Loras Tyrell as soon as Tommen marries Margaery.,4,10
CERSEI, I will not.,4,10
TYWIN," Jaime cannot marry or inherit lands. Tyrion's sentence will be carried out tomorrow. You have, on several occasions, made great claims about your commitment to this family's future. Your role in that future is more vital now than it ever was.",4,10
CERSEI," I don't care. I will stay in King's Landing where I belong with my son, the king.",4,10
TYWIN," When you were nine years old, I was called to the capital. I decided to take your brother with me and not you. You insisted that you would not be left at Casterly Rock under any circumstances and if you recall-",4,10
CERSEI, I'm not interested in hearing another one of your smug stories about the time you won. This isn't going to be one of those times.,4,10
TYWIN, Do you think you'll be the first person dragged into a sept to be married against her will?,4,10
CERSEI," When you marched into the throne room to tell me we'd won the Battle at Blackwater, do you remember?! I was sitting on the iron throne with Tommen. I was about to give him essence of nightshade, that's how far I was willing to go when I thought someone awful had come to take my son away. Someone awful is coming to take him away.",4,10
TYWIN, No.,4,10
CERSEI," Joffrey is dead. Myrcella's been sold like livestock. And now you want to ship me off to Highgarden and steal my boy, my last boy. Margaery will dig her claws in and you will dig your claws in and you will fight over him like beasts until you rip him apart. I will burn our house to the ground before I let that happen.",4,10
TYWIN, And how will you do that?,4,10
CERSEI, I'll tell everyone the truth.,4,10
TYWIN, And what truth would that be?,4,10
CERSEI," You don't know, do you? You never believed it. How is that possible? What am I saying, of course it's possible. How can someone so consumed by the idea of his family have any conception what his actual family was doing? We were right there in front of you and you didn't see us. One look in the past twenty years, one real look and you would've known.",4,10
TYWIN, Known what?,4,10
CERSEI, Everything they say is true about Jaime and me.,4,10
TYWIN," No, no, no, no, no.",4,10
CERSEI, Your legacy is a lie.,4,10
TYWIN, I don't believe you.,4,10
CERSEI, Yes you do.,4,10
CERSEI, Jaime.,4,10

CERSEI," For my family, no. I would do things for my family you couldn't imagine.",4,10
JAIME, Tyrion is your family.,4,10
CERSEI, He's not.,4,10
JAIME, You don't get to choose.,4,10
CERSEI," I do, so do you. You can choose the creature that killed our mother to come into this world-",4,10
JAIME, Are you really mad enough to blame him for that? He didn't decide to kill her. He was an infant.,4,10
CERSEI," A disease doesn't decide to kill you, all the same you cut it out before it does. What do you decide? What do you choose?",4,10
JAIME," The things I did to get back to you, to endure all that, only to find you-",4,10
CERSEI, I choose you.,4,10
JAIME, Those are words.,4,10
CERSEI, Yes. Like the ones I just said to father. I told him.,4,10
JAIME, Told him what?,4,10
CERSEI, I told him about us.,4,10
JAIME, You told him?,4,10
CERSEI," I told him I wouldn't marry Loras Tyrell. I told him I'm staying right here with Tommen, with you.",4,10
JAIME, You think he'll just accept that?,4,10
CERSEI, Go and ask him.,4,10
JAIME, What did you say?,4,10
CERSEI," I don't want to talk about Tywin Lannister. I don't choose Tywin Lannister, I don't love Tywin Lannister. I love my brother. I love my lover. People will whisper, they'll make their jokes. Let them. They're all so small I can't even see them. I only see what matters.",4,10

FENNESZ," Your grace, I ask you to let me sell myself back to Master Mighdal.",4,10
DAENERYS," You want to return to a man who owned you, like a goat or a chair?",4,10
FENNESZ," Please, your grace, the young may rejoice in the new world you've built for them. But for those of us too old to change there is only fear and squalor. I am not alone. There are many outside waiting to beg the same-",4,10
DAENERYS, I did not take this city to preside over the injustice I fought to destroy. I took it to bring people freedom. But freedom means making your own choices. I will allow you to sign a contract with your former master. It may not cover a period lasting longer than a year.,4,10

MELARA, We shouldn’t be out here alone.,5,1
CERSEI, Why not?,5,1
MELARA, If your father hears…,5,1
CERSEI, He’ll never know we’ve been gone.,5,1
MELARA, But if he finds out…,5,1
CERSEI, You don’t need to be afraid of my father.,5,1
MELARA, Are you sure?,5,1
CERSEI, Yes.,5,1
MELARA, We shouldn’t go in.,5,1
CERSEI, Of course we should.,5,1
MAGGY, Get out. Get out!,5,1
MELARA, Let’s go…,5,1
CERSEI, No.,5,1
MAGGY, Listen to your friend.,5,1
CERSEI, They said that you were terrifying. With cat’s teeth and three eyes. You’re not terrifying. You’re boring.,5,1
MAGGY, You don’t know what I am.,5,1
CERSEI, I know you’re a witch and you can see the future. Tell me mine.,5,1
MAGGY, Everybody wants to know their future. Until they know their future.,5,1
CERSEI, This is my father’s land. My land. Tell me my future or I’ll have your two boring eyes gouged out of your head.,5,1
MAGGY, Your blood. Give me a taste.,5,1
MAGGY, Three questions you get. You won’t like the answers.,5,1
CERSEI, I’ve been promised to the prince. When will we marry?,5,1
MAGGY, You’ll never wed the prince. You’ll wed the king.,5,1
CERSEI, But I will be queen?,5,1
MAGGY," Oh yes, you’ll be queen. For a time. In comes another. Younger, more beautiful, to cast you down and take all you hold dear.",5,1
CERSEI, Will the king and I have children?,5,1
MAGGY," No. The king will have 20 children, and you will have 3.",5,1
CERSEI, That doesn’t make sense.,5,1
MAGGY, Gold will be their crowns. Gold their shrouds.,5,1

PRIEST," Your grace, we are honored by your presence. The mourners are waiting.",5,1
CERSEI, They will keep waiting. I want a moment alone with him.,5,1
PRIEST," But your grace, many of these lords and ladies have travelled day and night to be here…",5,1
PRIEST, From all seven kingdoms…,5,1
CERSEI, They will wait.,5,1
CERSEI," He never wanted you to be a King’s Guard, but here you are, protecting his dead body.",5,1
JAIME," What he built. The towers. He built it for us. He meant it for us. They’re going to try to take it away, all of it.",5,1
CERSEI, They?,5,1
JAIME, All of them out there are enemies. They’re waiting a night to make sure he’s really dead and as soon as they see the stones on his eyes they’ll set to work on tearing us apart.,5,1
CERSEI," They had nothing to do with it. The man who murdered our father, he tore us apart, he’s the enemy. I’ve been telling you for years, you’ve been defending him for years…",5,1
JAIME, This is exactly what they want.,5,1
CERSEI, ...and now our father is dead. And that little monster is out there somewhere drawing breath. Did you set him free?,5,1
CERSEI," Tyrion may be a monster but at least he killed our father on purpose. You killed him by mistake. With stupidity. You’re a man of action, aren’t you? When it occurs to you to do something you do it, nevermind the consequences. Take a look. (gestures towards Tywin) Look at the consequences. Here they are. He loved you more than anyone in this world.",5,1
VARYS, Apologies.,5,1
TYRION, I still don’t see why I had to stay in this fucking crate once we set sail.,5,1
VARYS," I saved your life. If they catch you, they catch me. I cannot say I feel overly guilty about leaving you in that “fucking crate”.",5,1
TYRION, Do you know what it’s like to stuff your shit through one of those air holes?,5,1
VARYS, No. I only know what it’s like to pick up your shit and throw it overboard.,5,1
TYRION, Pentos?,5,1
VARYS," The home of my colleague. Ilyrio Mopatis. A merchant. He and I met many years ago, through mutual friends. A group of people who saw Robert Baratheon for the disaster he was. We tried to do what was best for the realm by supporting the Targaryen restoration. And thus began the chain of mistakes that has led us both here. Things have gotten worse, not better. Westeros needs to be saved from itself.",5,1
TYRION, Much better.,5,1
VARYS, My lord?,5,1
TYRION, I don’t think I am anymore. A lord. Are you a lord if you kill your father? I don’t suppose they revoke your nobility for killing a whore. That has to be happen all the time.,5,1
VARYS, You already drank yourself across the Narrow Sea.,5,1
TYRION, In a box. Why stop now?,5,1
VARYS, Because we are talking about the future of our country.,5,1
TYRION, The future is shit. Just like the past.,5,1

DAENERYS, They’ve never killed before.,5,1
BARRISTAN," It was only a matter of time, your grace. Conquerors are always met with resistance.",5,1
DAENERYS, I didn’t conquer them. Their own people did.,5,1
MOSSADOR," They do not see us as people, Your Grace.",5,1
DAENERYS," Then they will have to learn to see things differently, Mossador. He did not risk his life fighting for freedom so cowards in masks could take it away. And I did not take up residence in this pyramid so I could watch the city below decline into chaos. What was the name of the man you lost?",5,1
GREY WORM," White Rat, your grace.",5,1
DAENERYS, I want him buried with honor. Publicly. In the Temple of the Graces.,5,1
BARRISTAN, The Sons of the Harpy will hear that message.,5,1
MOSSADOR, Make them very angry.,5,1
DAENERYS, Angry snakes lash out. Makes chopping off their heads that much easier. Find the men who did this and bring them to me.,5,1

MISSANDEI," White Rat, the Unsullied who… I have heard they found his body in a brothel. I have heard that more than one Unsullied has been known to visit Meereen’s brothels. May I ask you why? Why would an Unsullied go to a brothel?",5,1

ALLISER, Not soldiers.,5,1
GILLY, That one hates me.,5,1
SAM, If Ser Alliser is chosen as the new Lord Commander… he hates the wildlings.,5,1
SAM, All the wildlings.,5,1
GILLY, Don’t let them send us away.,5,1
SAM," It’s not a sure thing. Ser Denys Mallister has commanded the Shadow Tower for 20 years, and people say he’s a good man. He’s running against Ser Alliser--",5,1

MELISANDRE, Your grace. The bastard of Winterfell.,5,1
STANNIS, You know who rules at Winterfell now?,5,1
JON, Roose Bolton.,5,1
STANNIS, The traitor who plunged a dagger into Robb Stark’s heart. Don’t you want to avenge him?,5,1
JON," I want a great many things, your grace. But I’m a sworn brother of the Night’s Watch now.",5,1
DAVOS, I’ve been talking to your sworn brothers. Many of them love you.,5,1
JON, They’re good men.,5,1
DAVOS, Many don’t. You were seen taking the body of a wildling girl north of the Wall. Why?,5,1
JON, It’s where she belonged.,5,1
DAVOS, Some of the Night’s Watch feel you have too much affection for the wildlings.,5,1
JON, They were born on the wrong side of the wall. That doesn’t make them monsters.,5,1
STANNIS, No matter. I shall take back the North from the thieves who stole it. Tywin Lannister is dead. He can’t protect them now. I shall mount Roose Bolton’s head on a spike. But if I’m to take Winterfell I’ll need more men.,5,1
JON, The men of the Night’s Watch are sworn to play no part--,5,1
STANNIS, I’m not talking about the damn Night’s Watch. I’m talking about the wildlings.,5,1
JON," Your grace, you want the wildlings to march in your army?",5,1
STANNIS," If they swear to follow me, I’ll pardon them. We’ll take Winterfell. Once the North is won, I’ll declare them citizens of the realm. I’ll give them land to live on.",5,1
DAVOS, It’s a fair offer. More than fair.,5,1
STANNIS, I’ll offer them their lives and their freedom if Mance kneels before me and swears his loyalty.,5,1
JON, I don’t think that’s likely.,5,1
STANNIS," You admire him, don’t you?",5,1
JON, I respect him.,5,1
STANNIS, He likes you. Convince him to bend the knee...,5,1
JON, Your grace…,5,1

MASTER OF ARMS (O.S.)," Sword up, my lord!",5,1

ROYCE, He’s 13. Boys go to war at 13.,5,1
BAELISH, He has other gifts.,5,1
ROYCE, Does he?,5,1
BAELISH, The gift of a great name. Sometimes that’s all one needs.,5,1
SANSA," Goodbye Lord Royce, and thank you for all you’ve done for me.",5,1
ROYCE," I have done nothing more than my duty, my lady.",5,1

PODRICK," Will we head north at some point? He said Sansa had a brother at Castle Black. We’re a few days ride from the Kingsroad, but that will take us--",5,1
BRIENNE, Us? The only reason you’re here is that Jaime Lannister told me you weren’t safe in the capital. You’re hundreds of miles from King’s Landing. No one knows what you look like. No one cares. You’re safe.,5,1
PODRICK, But I’m you’re squire.,5,1
BRIENNE, Do you even know what a squire is?,5,1
PODRICK, An attendant to a knight?,5,1
BRIENNE, I’m not a knight. That means you’re not a squire.,5,1
PODRICK," Well, where would I go?",5,1
BRIENNE," I don’t care, I’m not your mother.",5,1
PODRICK, You swore to find the Stark girls.,5,1
BRIENNE, I found Arya. She didn’t want my protection.,5,1
PODRICK, Sansa still might.,5,1
BRIENNE, Will you shut your mouth? I didn’t ask for advice. I don’t want anyone following me. I’m not a leader. All I ever wanted is to fight for a Lord I believed in. The good lords are dead and the rest are monsters.,5,1
SANSA, You told Lord Royce we were going to the Fingers.,5,1
BAELISH, I did.,5,1
SANSA, But we’re heading west.,5,1
BAELISH, We are.,5,1
SANSA," If he wanted to betray us, he already would have.",5,1
BAELISH," Lord Royce may be as honorable as he thinks he is, but he’s not alone in that castle. Do you trust all those knights and ladies, stable boys and serving girls?",5,1
SANSA, No. Do you trust the carriage driver or the knights escorting us?,5,1
BAELISH," No. But I pay them well, and they’ve seen what happens to men who disappoint me.",5,1
SANSA, So where are we going? To a land where you trust everyone?,5,1
BAELISH," So a land so far from here, even Cersei Lannister can’t get her hands on you.",5,1

CERSEI (sighs), Thank you so much for your kind words.,5,1
GRAND MAESTER PYRCELLE," Deepest condolences, your grace. This tragedy… I never trusted Varys. I often warned…",5,1

CERSEI, Cousin Lancel. I hardly recognized you.,5,1
LANCEL, My deepest sympathies.,5,1
KEVAN LANNISTER, I apologize for my son’s appearance.,5,1
CERSEI," Uncle, it’s quite alright.",5,1
KEVAN," They call themselves sparrows. Bloody fanatics. Religion has its place, of course, but at a certain point… They never would have come to the capital when Tywin was alive.",5,1
CERSEI, I’m sure he’ll grow out of it. Whatever it is. Excuse me.,5,1
KEVAN, Of course.,5,1
CERSEI, Your wounds from the Blackwater seem to have healed.,5,1
LANCEL, It wasn’t my wounds that needed healing.,5,1
CERSEI, What can I do for you?,5,1
LANCEL, You can forgive me.,5,1
CERSEI, What could you possibly have done to warrant my forgiveness?,5,1
LANCEL, I led you into the darkness.,5,1
CERSEI, I doubt you’ve ever led anyone anywhere.,5,1
LANCEL," I tempted you into our unnatural relations. And, of course, there was the king. His boar hunt. His wine.",5,1
CERSEI, I don’t know what you’re talking about.,5,1
LANCEL," I’m a different person now. I found peace in the light of the Seven. You can too. They watch over all of us, ready to dole out mercy… or justice. Their world is at hand. I will pray for your father’s soul.",5,1

OLYVAR, It looks like Dorne.,5,1
LORAS, No it doesn’t.,5,1
OLYVAR, It does. That’s the Sunspear bit right there. And that’s where the mountains are. And over here is… Sunsnake? Stonespear?,5,1
LORAS, Sandstone.,5,1
OLYVAR," Yes. Yes, Sandstone. Just there.",5,1
LORAS, Fine.,5,1
LORAS, It’s Dorne.,5,1
OLYVAR, We should go there. I think we would have a lovely time.,5,1
LORAS," Judging by my experience, that would be wonderful. Dorne, Highgarden. Anywhere but here.",5,1
MARGAERY, We’re late for dinner as it is.,5,1
LORAS, You’re very respectful.,5,1
MARGAERY, I’m very hungry.,5,1
MARGAERY, What’s your name?,5,1
OLYVAR," Olyvar, my lady.",5,1
MARGAERY," I’m afraid my brother is keeping the king waiting, Olyvar.",5,1
MARGAERY, Perhaps you might consider being a bit more discreet?,5,1
LORAS, Why? They all know about me anyway. Everybody knows everything about everyone. What’s the point in trying to keep a secret in a place like this?,5,1
MARGAERY, In any event… (throws Loras his clothes) you shouldn’t keep your intended waiting.,5,1
LORAS, My intended? Please. Tywin’s dead. That means no one can force Cersei to marry me.,5,1
MARGAERY, Lucky you.,5,1
LORAS, Unlucky you.,5,1
MARGAERY, You think I want that woman married to my brother?,5,1
LORAS," If she doesn’t marry me, she doesn’t go to Highgarden. Which means she stays in King’s Landing. Which means you’re trapped here with Cersei Lannister as your mother-by-law.",5,1

TYRION, Not for a coward.,5,1
VARYS," You are many things, my friend, but not a coward.",5,1
TYRION, You never told me why you set me free.,5,1
VARYS, Your brother asked me to.,5,1
TYRION, You could have said no.,5,1
VARYS, Refuse the Kingslayer? A dangerous proposition.,5,1
TYRION," Not as dangerous as releasing me. You risked your life, your position, everything. Why? You’re not family, you owe me nothing.",5,1
VARYS, I didn’t do it for you. I did it for the Seven Kingdoms.,5,1
TYRION, A drunken dwarf will never be the savior of the Seven Kingdoms.,5,1
VARYS, I don’t believe in saviors. I believe men of talent have a role to play in the war to come.,5,1
TYRION, You’re going to have to find another soldier. I’m done with Westeros and Westeros is done with me.,5,1
VARYS," You have many admirable qualities, self-pity is not one of them. Any fool with a bit of luck can find himself born into power. But earning it for yourself, that takes work.",5,1
TYRION, I’m not well-suited for work.,5,1
VARYS," I think you are. You have your father’s instinct for politics, and you have compassion.",5,1
TYRION, Compassion? Yes. I killed my lover with my bare hands. I shot my own father with a crossbow.,5,1
VARYS, I never said you were perfect.,5,1
TYRION, What is it you want exactly?,5,1
VARYS, Peace. Prosperity. A land where the powerful do not prey on the powerless.,5,1
TYRION," Where the castles are made of gingerbread and the moats are filled with blackberry wine. The powerful have always preyed on the powerless, that’s how they became powerful in the first place.",5,1
VARYS," Perhaps. And perhaps we’ve grown so used to horror we assume there’s no other way. If you sat on the Iron Throne, would you spread misery throughout the land?",5,1
TYRION, I will never sit on the Iron Throne.,5,1
VARYS," No, you won’t. But you could help another climb those steps and take that seat. The Seven Kingdoms need someone stronger than Tommen, but gentler than Stannis. A monarch who can intimidate the high lord and inspire the people. A ruler loved by millions with a powerful army and the right family name.",5,1
TYRION, Good luck finding him.,5,1
VARYS," Who said anything about him? You have a choice my friend. You can stay here at Ilyrio’s palace and drink yourself to death, or you can ride with me to Mereen, meet Daenerys Targaryen, and decide if the world is worth fighting for.",5,1
TYRION, Can I drink myself to death on the road to Meereen?,5,1
CUT TO, MEEREEN,5,1
DAARIO NAHARIS, When did the Unsullied start patrolling the streets of Meereen? Looks like your friends haven’t been behaving themselves.,5,1
HIZDAHR ZO LORAQ," The mission to Yunkai was a resounding success. The Wise Masters of Yunkai have agreed to cede power to a council of elders, made up of both the freedmen and the former slaveholders. All matters of consequence will be brought to you for review.",5,1
DAENERYS, Good.,5,1
HIZDAHR, They did ask for some concessions.,5,1
DAENERYS, Concessions?,5,1
HIZDAHR," Politics is the art of compromise, your grace.",5,1
DAENERYS, I’m not a politician. I’m a queen.,5,1
HIZDAHR," Forgive me. You’re right, of course. Still, it’s easier to rule happy subjects than angry ones.",5,1
DAENERYS," I don’t expect the Wise Masters to be happy. Slavery made them rich, I ended slavery.",5,1
HIZDAHR, They do not ask for the return of slavery. They ask for the re-opening of the fighting pits.,5,1
DAENERYS, The fighting pits? Where slaves fought slaves to the death?,5,1
HIZDAHR," In the new world that you’ve brought to us, free men would fight free men.",5,1
HIZDAHR, The pitfighters that you liberated plead for this opportunity. Bring some here and ask them yourself.,5,1
DAENERYS, No fighting pits.,5,1
HIZDAHR, Opening them would show the people of Yunkai and Meereen that you respect their traditions.,5,1
DAENERYS, I do not respect the tradition of human cockfighting.,5,1
HIZDAHR, If you--,5,1
DAENERYS, How many times must I say no before you understand?,5,1
DAENERYS, Whatever he wants from me he’s not going to get it. If he really believes I’m going to reopen the fighting pits…,5,1
DAARIO, You should reopen the fighting pits.,5,1
DAENERYS, What?,5,1
DAARIO," My mother was a whore, I told you that. She liked to drink pear brandy. The older she got, the less she made selling her body, the more she wanted to drink. So one day when I was 12, she sold me to a slaver she fucked the night before.",5,1
DAENERYS, Why?,5,1
DAARIO," I was a bad child. I wasn’t big, but I was quick. And I loved to fight. So they sold me to a man in Tolos who trained fighters for the pits. I had my first match when I was 16.",5,1
DAENERYS," You were sold into slavery, forced to fight to the death for the amusement of the masters, and you’re defending the fighting pits?",5,1
DAARIO," I’m only here because of those pits. I learned to fight like a Dothraki screamer, a Norvoshi priest, a Westerosi knight. Soon I was famous. 10,000 men and women screamed my name when I stepped into the pit. I made so much money for my master he set me free when I died. I joined the Second Sons, and then I met you.",5,1
DAARIO," You’re the queen. Everyone’s too afraid of you to speak truth. Everyone but me. You’ve made thousands of enemies all across the world. As soon as they see weakness, they’ll attack. Show your strength here, now.",5,1
DAENERYS, That’s why I have the Unsullied patrolling the streets.,5,1
DAARIO (scoffs), Anyone with a chest full of gold can buy an army of Unsullied. You’re not the Mother of Unsullied. You’re the Mother of Dragons.,5,1
DAENERYS, I don’t want another child’s bones dropped at my feet. No one’s seen Drogon in weeks. For all I know he’s flown halfway across the world. I can’t control them anymore.,5,1
DAARIO, A dragon queen with no dragons is not a queen.,5,1

MANCE," When we first met you were my prisoner. And now, for our last meeting…",5,1
JON, This doesn’t have to be our last meeting.,5,1
MANCE," No, but it will be.",5,1
JON, You know what Stannis wants?,5,1
MANCE, He wants me to bend the knee. And he wants the free folk to fight for him. I’ll give him this much: he’s bold.,5,1
MANCE, He wants me to bend the knee. And he wants the free folk to fight for him. I’ll give him this much: he’s bold.,5,1
JON, Shouldn’t a king be bold?,5,1
MANCE," Oh, aye. I respect him. If he gets what he wants, I expect he’ll be a better ruler than the fools sitting on the Iron Throne the last hundred years. But I’ll never serve him.",5,1
JON, You told me you weren’t here to conquer. You told me your people have bled enough.,5,1
MANCE, That’s right. But I don’t want them bleeding for Stannis Baratheon either.,5,1
JON," You spent your life convincing 90 clans to come together for the first time in history. Thenns and Hornfoots, the ice-river clans, even the giants. A life’s work uniting them. You didn’t do it for power. You didn’t do it for glory. You brought them together to save them because none of them will survive the winter, not if they’re north of the wall. Isn’t their survival more important than your pride?",5,1
MANCE, Pride? Fuck my pride. This isn’t about that.,5,1
JON, Then bend the knee and save your people.,5,1
MANCE, They followed me because they respected me. Because they believed in me. The moment I kneel for a Southern king that’s all gone.,5,1
JON, And how many tens of thousands are out there right now? How many women? How many children? And you won’t go out and rescue them because why? You’re afraid of looking afraid.,5,1
MANCE," Oh, I am afraid. No shame in that. How will they do it? Beheading? Hanging?",5,1
JON, They’ll burn you alive.,5,1
MANCE," Bad way to go. I’ll be honest with you, I don’t want to die. And burnt to death, I don’t want people to remember me like that. Scorched and screaming. But it’s better than betraying everything I believe.",5,1
JON," And what happens to your people? You preserve your dignity and die standing, and they’ll sing songs about you. “You’d rather burn than kneel. The great hero.” Until winter comes, and the white walkers come for us all, and there’s no one left to sing.",5,1
MANCE," You’re a good lad. Truly, you are. But if you can’t understand why I won’t enlist my people in a foreigner’s war, there’s no point explaining.",5,1
JON, I think you’re making a terrible mistake.,5,1
MANCE, The freedom to make my own mistakes was all I ever wanted.,5,1
STANNIS," Mance Rayder, you’ve been called the King Beyond the Wall. Westeros only has one king. Bend the knee, I promise you mercy.",5,1
STANNIS, Kneel and live.,5,1
MANCE, This was my home for many years. I wish you good fortune in the wars to come.,5,1
MELISANDRE," Man or woman, young or old, lord or peasant, our choices are the same. We choose light, or we choose darkness. We choose good, or we choose evil. We choose the true god or the false.",5,1
MELISANDRE," Free folk, there is only one true king, and his name is Stannis. Here stands the king of lies. Behold the fate of those who choose the darkness.",5,1
BRAAVOSI MAN," In the old times, whenever Braavos stood in danger, the titan would step with fire in his eyes. He'd wade into the sea and smash the enemies.",5,2
ARYA, He's just a statue.,5,2
MAN, Don't be afraid. He’s announcing our arrival.,5,2
ARYA, I'm not afraid.,5,2
MAN, The House of Black and White: this is where you'll find the man you seek.,5,2
MAN, The House of Black and White: this is where you'll find the man you seek.,5,2
MAN," Here, I leave you.",5,2
ARYA, Thank you for bringing me.,5,2
MAN, Any man of Braavos would have done the same. Valar morghulis.,5,2
ARYA, Valar dohaeris.,5,2
ARYA, Hello. Valar Morghulis.,5,2
ARYA, Jaqen H’ghar gave me this.,5,2
OLD MAN, No one here by that name.,5,2
ARYA, Please. I crossed the Narrow Sea. I have nowhere else to go.,5,2
OLD MAN, You have everywhere else to go.,5,2
ARYA, But wait!,5,2
ARYA," Cersei, Walder Frey, The Mountain, Meryn Trant. Cersei, Walder Frey, The Mountain, Meryn Trant.",5,2
ARYA," ...The Mountain, Meryn Trant.",5,2
PODRICK, Must be good food if it’s crowded.,5,2
WAITRESS, Ale? (pours ale and leaves table; goes to another table) Ale?,5,2
Cut to another table in the inn, Sansa and Littlefinger's,5,2
SANSA," Before we left, a maester gave you a raven scroll.",5,2
BAELISH, You are becoming an observant young lady.,5,2
SANSA," My mother used to say, ""dark wings, dark words"".",5,2
BAELISH, An old saying. Inaccurate in this case.,5,2
SANSA, So it was good news.?,5,2
BAELISH, My marriage proposal has been accepted.,5,2
SANSA, I thought you still mourn the death of my beloved Aunt Lysa.,5,2
WAITRESS, Ale?,5,2
SANSA, I'll have some.,5,2
PODRICK, My lady!,5,2
BRIENNE, What is it?,5,2
PODRICK, Sansa Stark. (Brienne begins to turn around) Don't look!,5,2
BRIENNE, You sure?,5,2
PODRICK," She's dyed her hair, but it's her. She's sitting with Petyr Baelish.",5,2
BRIENNE, Littlefinger?,5,2
PODRICK, A bunch of knights with him.,5,2
PODRICK," 10, I think. Too many. My lady, I don't think this is the right--",5,2
BRIENNE, Ready the horses.,5,2
PODRICK, We only have one horse.,5,2
BRIENNE, Find more.,5,2
BAELISH, Do you like the taste?,5,2
SANSA, I don't see what all the fuss is about. Why do men love it so much?,5,2
BAELISH, It gives some men courage.,5,2
SANSA, Does it give you courage?,5,2
GUARD, That's far enough.,5,2
BRIENNE," Lord Baelish, Lady Sansa, my name is Brienne of Tarth.",5,2
BAELISH," We've met. With Renly Baratheon. What did he say about you? He said, ""You're a loyalty comes free of charge."" Someone appears to have paid quite a bit for it since then.",5,2
BRIENNE," Lady Sansa, before your mother's death, I was her sworn sword. I gave my word I would find you and protect you. I will shield your back and keep your council, and give my life for yours if need be. I swear it by the old gods and the new.",5,2
BAELISH," Please, Lady Brienne. No need for such formality. (Brienne gets up) You are Catelyn Stark's sworn sword?",5,2
BRIENNE, I was.,5,2
BAELISH, Strange. I knew Cat from the time we were children. She never mentioned you.,5,2
BRIENNE, It was after Renly's murder.,5,2
BAELISH," Ah, yes. You were accused of killing him.",5,2
BRIENNE, I tried to save him.,5,2
BAELISH, But you were accused.,5,2
BRIENNE, By men who didn't see what happened.,5,2
BAELISH, Then what did happen?,5,2
BRIENNE, He was murdered by a shadow. A shadow with a face of Stannis Baratheon.,5,2
BAELISH, A shadow? With a face? (scoffs) This woman swore to protect Renly; she failed. She swore to protect your mother; she failed. Why would I want somebody with your history of failure guiding Lady Sansa?,5,2
BRIENNE, Why should you have any say in her affairs?,5,2
BAELISH," Because I am her uncle. I married her Aunt Lysa shortly before my beloved’s untimely death. We're family now, and you're an outsider. Forgive me, Lady Brienne, but experiences made me wary of outsiders.",5,2
BRIENNE," Lady Sansa, if we can have a word alone--",5,2
SANSA, No.,5,2
BRIENNE," Please, my lady. If I could explain--",5,2
SANSA, I saw you at Joffrey's wedding bowing to the king.,5,2
BRIENNE, Neither of us wanted to be there. Sometimes we don't have a choice.,5,2
SANSA, And sometimes we do. You should leave.,5,2
BAELISH, We don't want our new friend wandering the countryside alone. The roads of these parts aren't safe. Why don't you stay?,5,2
KNIGHT 1, He asked you to stay.,5,2
GUARD, After her!,5,2
BRIENNE, Podrick! (Podrick screams as he loses control of the horse),5,2
PODRICK," Stop, stop, stop! (Horse stops) That’s a good boy.",5,2
KNIGHT, I guess that means you’re unarmed.,5,2
BRIENNE," Down, Podrick, down!",5,2
BRIENNE, Podrick?,5,2
PODRICK," Yes, my lady?",5,2
BRIENNE, You can stand now.,5,2
PODRICK," Yes, my lady. (stands) Sansa Stark?",5,2
BRIENNE," Wary of strangers, as she should me. I saw her riding on the East Trail with Littlefinger. We’ll follow them.",5,2
PODRICK," My lady, if those Stark girls refused your service, maybe you’re released from your vow.",5,2
BRIENNE, I swore to their mother I’d protect those girls.,5,2
PODRICK, If they don’t want your protection--,5,2
BRIENNE, Do you think she’s safe from Littlefinger?,5,2
PODRICK," (pause) No, my lady.",5,2
BRIENNE, Get your horse.,5,2
JAIME, A summons from the queen.,5,2
CERSEI, There are only two like it in the world: the one I’m wearing and the one I gave to Myrcella.,5,2
CERSEI, There are only two like it in the world: the one I’m wearing and the one I gave to Myrcella.,5,2
JAIME, It’s a threat.,5,2
CERSEI," Of course it’s a threat! Our daughter’s in Dorne surrounded by people who hate our family. (mocking) ""It's a threat.""",5,2
JAIME, No note.,5,2
CERSEI," They blame us for the death of Oberyn and his sister, and every other tragedy that’s befallen their cursed country. I will burn their cities to the ground if they touch her!",5,2
JAIME, Softer.,5,2
CERSEI, What?,5,2
JAIME, Not so loud.,5,2
CERSEI," Our daughter’s in danger, and you’re worried I’m speaking too loudly!",5,2
JAIME, The world can't know knows she’s our daughter.,5,2
CERSEI, Then don’t call her your daughter. You’ve never been a father to her.,5,2
JAIME," If I was the father to any of my children, they’d be stoned in the streets.",5,2
CERSEI, And what has your caution brought? Our eldest child murdered at his own wedding. Our only daughter shipped off to Dorne. Our baby boy sent to marry that smirking whore from Highgarden.,5,2
JAIME, I’ll make things better.,5,2
CERSEI, You never made anything better.,5,2
JAIME, I’m going to Dorne. I’ll bring our daughter home.,5,2
CERSEI, You can’t just ask Prince Doran to give her back! She’s promised his son.,5,2
JAIME, I’m not going to ask him anything.,5,2
CERSEI," You go there with an army, it’s an act of war.",5,2
JAIME, No army. Do you know where they’re keeping her?,5,2
CERSEI, Oberyn mentioned the Water Gardens.,5,2
JAIME," I’ll find her. Is there anything else, your grace?",5,2
CERSEI, (scoffs) You’re going to Dorne? A one-handed man? Alone?,5,2
JAIME, I never said I was going alone. (exit Jaime),5,2
LOLLYS STOKEWORTH," No sunflowers. I don't like yellow. Roses are very nice, definitely roses. And music. I adore music. But no flutes, I hate flutes! We can have a harp if you like, but no flutes. Then there's the food. Food is the most important thing, don't you agree? We're going to need pigeon pies. That's what they eat in the capital, don't they?",5,2
LOLLYS, Don't they?,5,2
BRONN, Don't who?,5,2
LOLLYS, People eat pigeon pie in the capital.,5,2
BRONN," They certainly do, my dear. They certainly do.",5,2
BRONN," It's a fine place, isn't it? A fine place. I never thought I'd end up settling down in a place like this.",5,2
LOLLYS, You won't.,5,2
BRONN, Pardon?,5,2
LOLLYS," We won't get to live at Stokeworth. When Mother dies, my sister gets the castle because she's older.",5,2
BRONN, Oh.,5,2
LOLLYS," She hates me. She calls me mean names, and sometimes even still she pulls my hair when Mother isn't looking.",5,2
BRONN, You know what I think? I think you're a good person. And your sister is a mean person.,5,2
LOLLYS, She is.,5,2
BRONN," I've been all over the world. And if there's one thing I've learned, it's that meanness comes around. People like your sister, they always get what's coming to them eventually. One way or another.",5,2
LOLLYS, Who's that?,5,2
BRONN, Jaime fucking Lannister.,5,2
BRONN, Ser Jaime.,5,2
JAIME, Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.,5,2
BRONN, I was very sorry to hear about your father.,5,2
JAIME, Thank you.,5,2
BRONN (gestures to Lollys)," This is my betrothed, Lollys.",5,2
JAIME, A pleasure. (he kisses her hand),5,2
BRONN," Run along, love.",5,2
JAIME, Beautiful bride you've chosen. When were you planning on getting married?,5,2
BRONN, Just get on with it.,5,2
JAIME, On with what?,5,2
BRONN, What you're here for. There's no way this little visit could possibly mean anything good for me.,5,2
JAIME, It's very good for you.,5,2
BRONN, Lollys will be marrying Ser Wyllis Bracken.,5,2
JAIME, Mmm.,5,2
BRONN," We made a deal, your sister and I.",5,2
JAIME, I would have advised against that.,5,2
BRONN, How is this good for me?,5,2
JAIME," 'Cause you're going to come with me and help me with something important. And when we return, I'm going to give you a much better girl, and a much better castle.",5,2
BRONN, Return from where?,5,2
JAIME, As far south as south goes.,5,2
TRYSTANE (O.S.), My future queen.,5,2
AREO, The prince does not wish to be disturbed.,5,2
ELLARIA," Remove myself from my path, or I'll take that long axe and shove it--",5,2
DORAN, Captain. Let her pass.,5,2
ELLARIA," Your brother was murdered, and you sit here at the Water Gardens, staring at the sky and doing nothing.",5,2
DORAN," Oberyn was slain during a trial by combat. By law, that is not murder.",5,2
ELLARIA, Your brother--,5,2
DORAN, You don't have to remind me. He was my brother long before he was anything to you.,5,2
ELLARIA, What will you do about his death.,5,2
DORAN, I will bury him. I will mourn for him.,5,2
ELLARIA, You would have me go to war?,5,2
DORAN, You would have me go to war?,5,2
ELLARIA, The whole country would have you go to war.,5,2
DORAN, Then we are lucky the whole country does not decide.,5,2
ELLARIA, The Sand Snakes are with me. They have the love of their people. They will avenge your father while you sit here in your chair doing nothing.,5,2
ELLARIA," Oberyn is dead. And this Lannister girl skips about the Water Gardens eating our food, breathing our air. How many of your brothers and sisters do they have to kill?",5,2
DORAN, I loved my brother. And you made him very happy. For that you will always have a place in my heart. But we do not mutilate little girls for vengeance. Not here. Not while I rule.,5,2
ELLARIA, And how long will that be?,5,2
DAARIO (O.S.), The Unsullied are too conspicuous.,5,2
DAARIO," Anyone can see you coming from a mile off. Of course you haven't found any Sons of the Harpy. You haven't, have you?",5,2
DAARIO," My Second Sons, on the other hand, they drink, they whore, fight in the streets--they blend in. They overhear things in taverns, follow people from the taverns to nice, quiet alleys, break a few fingers, overhear a few more things. Before you know it...",5,2
GREY WORM, No one here. We go.,5,2
DAARIO, In a hurry? You're afraid?,5,2
GREY WORM, Unsullied fear nothing.,5,2
DAARIO," Right. That's your problem. You understood fear once, long ago, but you've forgotten what it means. Someone who's forgotten fear has forgotten how to hide.",5,2
DAARIO, Fear is useful that way.,5,2
MOSSADOR," Sons of the Harpy, they want to put a collar back on my neck. On all of our necks. Please, Your Grace, you must kill him.",5,2
DAENERYS, It would send a message.,5,2
BARRISTAN," I think you should exercise restraint, Your Grace.",5,2
DAENERYS, Why?,5,2
BARRISTAN," For one thing, he may have valuable information.",5,2
DAARIO, The Son of the Harpy has no more valuable information.,5,2
BARRISTAN, How do you know that?,5,2
DAARIO, Because I questioned him.,5,2
HIZDAHR," And the information you did get, he is young and poor.",5,2
MOSSADOR, He is born free.,5,2
HIZDAHR, Why should he want to bring back slavery? What did it do for him?,5,2
DAENERYS, Perhaps the only thing that gave him pride was knowing that there was someone lower than he was.,5,2
MOSSADOR, They pay him. Great families afraid to do a thing. They pay poor man to do it for them.,5,2
HIZDAHR, And how do you know this?,5,2
MOSSADOR, Everyone knows this.,5,2
HIZDAHR," I don't know it, and I'm the head of a great family.",5,2
BARRISTAN," We do not know what this man did or didn't do. (to Daenerys) Give him a trial, at least. A fair trial. Show all of the citizens of Meereen that you are better than those who would depose. Teach them a better way.",5,2
MOSSADOR," I do not know the place from where Old Ser comes. Things maybe are different there, I hope. But here, in Meereen, before Daenerys Stormborn, they own us. So we learn much about them or we do not live long. They teach me what they are. Mercy, fair trial: these mean nothing to them. All they understand is blood!",5,2
MOSSADOR," I do not know the place from where Old Ser comes. Things maybe are different there, I hope. But here, in Meereen, before Daenerys Stormborn, they own us. So we learn much about them or we do not live long. They teach me what they are. Mercy, fair trial: these mean nothing to them. All they understand is blood!",5,2
DAENERYS, Thank you all for your counsel.,5,2
BARRISTAN," Your Grace, a word, please, I beg you.",5,2
DAENERYS, About what?,5,2
BARRISTAN, About your father. About the Mad King.,5,2
DAENERYS, The Mad King? You're here to remind me of my enemies' lies? Consider me reminded.,5,2
BARRISTAN," Your Grace, I served in his Kingsguard. I was at his side from the first. Your enemies did not lie.",5,2
DAENERYS, Go on.,5,2
BARRISTAN," When the people rose in revolt against him, your father set their towns and castles aflame. He murdered sons in front of their fathers. He burned men alive with Wildfire, and laughed as they screamed. And his efforts to stamp out dissent led to rebellion that killed every Targaryen except two.",5,2
DAENERYS, I'm not my father.,5,2
BARRISTAN," No, Your Grace. Thank the gods. But the Mad King gave his enemies the justice he thought they deserved. And each time it made him feel powerful and right. Until the very end.",5,2
DAENERYS, I will not have the Son of the Harpy executed without a fair trial.,5,2
BARRISTAN (nods), Your Grace.,5,2
TYRION, There's a bug.,5,2
VARYS," Yes, best be careful. You might accidentally consume some solid food.",5,2
TYRION," When I agreed to come with you, did I misrepresent my intentions? (finishes his cup of wine) Besides, what is there for me to do inside this fucking box?",5,2
VARYS, You don't like it?,5,2
TYRION, I want to take a walk.,5,2
VARYS, You can't. Cersei has offered a lordship to the man who brings her your head.,5,2
TYRION," She ought to offer her cunt. Best part of her for the best part of me. Well, I suppose a box is as good a place for me as anywhere.",5,2
VARYS, Are we really going to spend the entire road to Volantis talking about the futility of everything?,5,2
TYRION, You're right. No point. (realizing) The road to Volantis? You said we were going to Meereen. What's in Volantis?,5,2
VARYS, The road to Meereen.,5,2
TYRION, And what do you hope to find at the end of the road to Meereen?,5,2
VARYS, I told you. A ruler.,5,2
TYRION, We've already got a ruler. Everywhere has already got a ruler. Every pile of shit on the side of every road has someone's banner hanging from it.,5,2
VARYS," You were quite good, you know. At ruling. During your brief tenure as Hand.",5,2
TYRION, I didn't rule. I was a servant.,5,2
VARYS," Still, a man of talent.",5,2
TYRION, Managed to kill a lot of people.,5,2
VARYS," Yes, but showed great promise in other areas as well.",5,2
TYRION, She wanted me to leave King's Landing. She begged me. I wouldn't go.,5,2
VARYS, Why?,5,2
TYRION, 'Cause I liked it. Power. Even as a servant. (takes a drink of wine),5,2
VARYS, People follow leaders. And they will never follow us. They find us repulsive.,5,2
TYRION, I find us repulsive.,5,2
VARYS," And we find them repulsive, which is why we surround ourselves with large, comfortable boxes to keep them away. And yet, no matter what we do, people like you and me are never really satisfied inside the box. Not for long.",5,2
TYRION, You're right. Let's go for a walk.,5,2
VARYS, No.,5,2
TYRION, How many dwarves are there in the world? Is Cersei going to kill them all?,5,2
CERSEI, Not him.,5,2
MERYN," Are you trying to deceive your Queen? Shall I throw them in a cell, Your Grace?",5,2
CERSEI," That won't be necessary, Ser Meryn. I don't want to dissuade the other hunters. Mistakes will be made.",5,2
HUNTERS," Thank you, Your Grace. Thank you.",5,2
CERSEI, Take the head.,5,2
QYBURN," Pardon me, Your Grace. I would take it, if you don't mind. It could prove useful for my work.",5,2
CERSEI, Very good.,5,2
QYBURN, Over there will be fine.,5,2
MERYN (to hunters), You heard the man. Over there.,5,2
KEVAN, You're the Hand of the King?,5,2
CERSEI," No, Uncle. Clearly it would not be appropriate for a woman to assume that role. I'm merely advising my son until he comes of age and chooses a Hand for himself.",5,2
MACE TYRELL," Your Grace, I would be willing to serve provisionally as the King's Hand until he becomes old enough--",5,2
CERSEI," You're a good man, Lord Tyrell, but I don't imagine you'll have the time. In addition to being Master of Ships, the king has appointed you Master of Coin.",5,2
MACE," Oh, Your Grace.",5,2
CERSEI, He called your experience and wisdom in financial matters unparalleled. He said he would be honored to have you represent the crown's interests in the same.,5,2
MACE," The honor is all mine, Your Grace.",5,2
PYCELLE," Your Grace, in the past on several occasions, a Grand Maester has served as the King's Hand.",5,2
CERSEI, The King has named Qyburn the new Master of Whisperers.,5,2
PYCELLE," Your Grace, him? This man? This embarrassment to the Citadel? Your Grace, what qualifications can he possibly have for this post?",5,2
CERSEI," The qualification of loyalty, Grand Maester. That's far more than the eunuch ever had. Far more than many ever have.",5,2
PYCELLE, I must say I cannot see--,5,2
CERSEI (cutting him off)," Uncle Kevan, in light of your position as commander of the Lannister armies, it would please the king if you would serve as his Master of War. No man living better deserves the title.",5,2
KEVAN, That is kind of you to say. I would like to hear it from the king himself.,5,2
CERSEI, The king is very busy at this moment.,5,2
KEVAN," He should be here, learning what it means to rule.",5,2
CERSEI," He is learning. On this occasion, in his capacity as ruler, he's asked me to speak on his behalf.",5,2
KEVAN, I returned to the capital to pay my respects to my brother. And to you. And to serve the king. I did not return to the capital to serve as your puppet. To watch you stack the small council with sycophants. (looks to Qyburn) Sending your own brother away so he wouldn't be--,5,2
CERSEI, My brother has left the capital to lead a sensitive diplomatic mission.,5,2
KEVAN, What mission?,5,2
CERSEI, That is not your concern as Master of War.,5,2
KEVAN, I do not recognize your authority to dictate what is and is not my concern. You are the Queen Mother. Nothing more.,5,2
CERSEI, You would abandon your king in his time of need?,5,2
KEVAN," If he wants to send for me, I will be waiting for him. At Casterly Rock.",5,2
SHIREEN, Come on. You know this one. It looks like an animal.,5,2
GILLY, Snake. Snake... S! It's an S!,5,2
SHIREEN," Right, very good!",5,2
SAM," Hmm! Did you know that the youngest Lord Commander in history, Osric Stark, was elected at the age of 10?",5,2
GILLY," I know ""S"".",5,2
SHIREEN," You'll learn, I promise. I taught Ser Davos, and old people are terrible at learning new things.",5,2
GILLY," Well, you're a wonderful teacher. (to Sam) Very patient!",5,2
SAM," I only said that the more time you spend practicing, the faster you'll be able to read.",5,2
GILLY, That's alright. We're doing just fine. I'm sure you and Ostrich Stark have a lot to talk about.,5,2
GILLY (to Shireen), How old were you when you learned to read?,5,2
SHIREEN, Three.,5,2
SAM (interjecting)," Three?! Who taught you, your mother?",5,2
SHIREEN, No. Old Maester Cressen did. I had a lot of time to practice. My mother kept me inside because... (trails off),5,2
GILLY (gently)," What do you call it in the South, what happened to your face?",5,2
SHIREEN, Greyscale. What do you call it north of the Wall?,5,2
GILLY, I don't know. But two of my sisters had it. They both died. How did they cure you?,5,2
SHIREEN," I don't remember. I was a baby. Lots of people came and tried, I think. Whatever they did, it went away. What happened to your sisters?",5,2
GILLY, My father made them move out of the keep into the huts outside. None of us were allowed to go near them. But we heard them. Especially at night. They started to sound... not like themselves.,5,2
SAM, Did you ever see them?,5,2
GILLY," Only once at the end. They were covered with it. Their faces, their arms. They acted like animals. My father had to drag them out to the woods on a rope.",5,2
SHIREEN, What did he do to them in the woods?,5,2
SHIREEN, Mother.,5,2
SELYSE (to Sam and Gilly), Leave us.,5,2
SAM (nodding), Your Grace.,5,2
SELYSE, You need to stay away from that girl.,5,2
SHIREEN, Why?,5,2
SELYSE, She's a wildling.,5,2
SHIREEN, Her name's Gilly. She's nice. I'm teaching her to read.,5,2
SELYSE, She's a wildling. Your father defeated their people. He executed her king for treason. They could strike at him by striking at you.,5,2
SHIREEN, Gilly wouldn't do that.,5,2
SELYSE, You have no idea what people will do. All your books and you still don't know.,5,2
STANNIS," I ordered Mance Rayder burnt at the stake. You prevented that order from being carried out. You showed mercy to Mance Rayder. A king's word is law. Perhaps you should ask Ser Davos how much mercy I show to lawbreakers. Show too much kindness, people won't fear you. If people don't fear you, they don't follow you.",5,2
JON," With respect, Your Grace, the free folk will never follow you, no matter what you do. You're the man who burned their king alive.",5,2
STANNIS, Who then? You?,5,2
JON, No. Only one of their own.,5,2
STANNIS, Do you know this wretched girl Lyanna Mormont?,5,2
JON, The Lord Commander's niece.,5,2
STANNIS," Lady of Bear Island, and a child of 10. I asked her to commit her house to my cause, that's her response.",5,2
JON," ""Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North, whose name is Stark."" (Jon smiles)",5,2
STANNIS, That amuses you?,5,2
JON," I apologize, Your Grace. Northerners can be a bit like the free folk. Loyal to their own.",5,2
STANNIS, I know. My brother Robert went on often and loudly about how difficult it was to control them - even with your father's help.,5,2
DAVOS," Tonight, the Night's Watch elect a new Lord Commander. Ser Alliser Thorne is going to win.",5,2
JON, Most likely.,5,2
DAVOS, Unpleasant man. He thinks you're a traitor. What's your life going to be like on the Wall with Thorne in command?,5,2
JON," Unpleasant, I expect.",5,2
STANNIS, Your bravery made him look weak. He'll punish you for it. I don't punish men for bravery. I reward them.,5,2
JON," I don't doubt it, Your Grace. But I'm a brother of the Night's Watch. I've pledged them my life, my honor, my sword. I don't know what I have left to give you.",5,2
STANNIS, You can give me the North.,5,2
JON," I can't. Even if I wanted to, I'm a bastard. A Snow.",5,2
STANNIS," Kneel before me. Lay your sword at my feet. Pledge me your service and you'll rise again as Jon Stark, Lord of Winterfell.",5,2
SAM, He'll make you a Stark with the stroke of a pen?,5,2
JON," It's the first thing I ever remember wanting. I'd daydream that my father would ask the king, and just like that I would never be the bastard of Winterfell again.",5,2
SAM, You deserve this. You do. I couldn't be happier for you.,5,2
JON, I'm going to refuse him.,5,2
SAM (confused), But you'd be Lord of Winterfell.,5,2
JON," I swore a vow to the Night's Watch. If I don't take my own word seriously, what sort of Lord of Winterfell would I be?",5,2
ALLISER (O.S.), Crowded. You'd think we were serving venison stew.,5,2
AEMON, Does anyone wish to speak for candidates before we cast our tokens for the 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch?,5,2
JANOS," Ser Alliser Thorne is not just a knight, he's a man of true nobility. He was acting commander when the Wall came under attack, and led us to victory against the wildlings.",5,2
MEN," Hear, hear.",5,2
JANOS, He's a veteran of 100 battles and has been a defender of the Watch and the Wall almost all of his life. He's the only true choice.,5,2
AEMON, Is there anyone else?,5,2
SHADOW TOWER BROTHER," Ser Denys Mallister joined the Watch as a boy and has served loyally longer than any other ranger. Through 10 winters he served. As commander of the Shadow Tower, he kept the wildlings away. We could do no better.",5,2
AEMON," If there's no one else, we will begin the voting. The triangular tokens count for Ser Alliser Thorne. The square tokens for Ser Denys Mallister. Each brother will--",5,2
SAM, Maester Aemon.,5,2
AEMON, Samwell Tarly. Go on.,5,2
JANOS (O.S.), Sam the Slayer.,5,2
JANOS, Another wildling lover just like his friend Jon Snow. How's your lady love Slayer?,5,2
SAM, Her name is Gilly. Brother Slynt knows her quite well. They cowered together in the larder during the battle for the Wall.,5,2
JANOS, Lies!,5,2
SAM," A wildling girl, a baby, and Lord Janos. I found him there when the battle was over in a puddle of his own making.",5,2
SAM," Whilst Lord Janos was hiding with the women and children, Jon Snow was leading.",5,2
SAM," Ser Alliser fought bravely, it is true. And when he was wounded, it is Jon who saved us. He took charge of the wall's defense. He killed the Magnar of the Thenns. (a man next to Sam nods) He went North to deal with Mance Rayder, knowing it almost certainly meant his own death. Before that, he led the mission to avenge Lord Commander Mormont. Mormont himself chose Jon to be his steward. He saw something in Jon, and now we've all seen it, too. He may be young, but he's the commander we turned to when the night was darkest.",5,2
ALLISER," I can't argue with any of that. (stands up) But who does Jon Snow want to command? Night's Watch or the wildlings? Everyone knows he loved a wildling girl and spoke with Mance Rayder many times. What would have happened in that tent between those two old friends if Stannis's army hadn't come along? We all saw him put the King-beyond-the-Wall out of his misery. Do you want to choose a man who has fought the wildlings all his life, or a man who makes love to them?",5,2
AEMON, It is time.,5,2
BROTHER," It appears to be a tie, Maester.",5,2
BROTHERS, Jon Snow! Jon Snow! Jon Snow! Jon Snow!,5,2
MAN, You. You!,5,2
MAN, What have you got there?,5,2
MAN, I said--,5,2
ARYA, Turn around and go. (pulls out Needle) Turn around and go.,5,2
Man," That's a nice little sword. Worth 100 pieces, a sword like that. (pulls out his own sword)",5,2
ARYA, Nothing's worth anything to dead men.,5,2
MEN," Quickly, go, go!",5,2
ARYA, Who are you? Why were they scared of you?,5,2
OLD MAN, You lost this.,5,2
ARYA, You said there was no Jaqen H'ghar here.,5,2
JAQEN, There isn't. A man is not Jaqen H'ghar.,5,2
ARYA, Well who are you then?,5,2
JAQEN, No one. And that is who a girl must become.,5,2
HARPY (Valyrian)," She doesn't belong here. And no matter how many of your traitors call her ""Mhysa"", she will never be your mother.",5,2
DAENERYS, Why?,5,2
MOSSADOR (Valyrian)," For you, Mhysa. (kneels) You wanted the Harpy dead, but your hands were tied. I set you free, as you did all of us.",5,2
DAENERYS," He was our prisoner, awaiting trial. You had no right.",5,2
MOSSADOR, He would rather rip your city apart than see slaves lifted from the dirt.,5,2
DAENERYS, There are no more slaves. There are no more Masters.,5,2
MOSSADOR," Then who lives in the Pyramids? Who wears gold masks and murders your children? (beat) When Grey Worm came to us, I was the first to take up the knife for you. I remember the look on my father's face as I struck down his Master, who had traded his infant son for a dog. My father died in the fighting. If we allow the Sons of the Harpy to return us to chains, he never lived.",5,2
DAENERYS," The Harpy's life was not yours to take. Once, the Masters were the law--",5,2
MOSADOR, --and now you are the law!,5,2
DAENERYS, The law is the law. Take him.,5,2
CROWD, Mhysa! Myhsa!,5,2
HIZDAHR (to Daario), She should have cut off the traitor's head in the Great Pyramid and been done with it.,5,2
DAARIO, Which is what I keep telling her to do to you.,5,2
"DAENERYS (Valyrian, to crowd)", You opened your gates to me because I promised you freedom and justice. One cannot exist without the other.,5,2
CROWD (Valyrian), Brother! Brother!,5,2
MOSSADOR (Valyrian)," Mhysa, please! Forgive me!",5,2
DAENERYS (Valyrian), A citizen of Meereen was awaiting trial and this man murdered him. The punishment is death.,5,2
CROWD (Valyrian), Mercy! Mercy!,5,2
MOSSADOR, Mhysa... (prays in Valyrian),5,2
CROWD, Mhysa...,5,2
BARRISTAN," I'll stand guard outside your door tonight, Your Grace.",5,2
GREY WORM, We all guard tonight.,5,2
DAENERYS, Leave me.,5,2
DAENERYS (shocked), Drogon...,5,2
MAN, Valar morghulis.,5,3
JAQEN, Valar dohaeris.,5,3
ARYA, I've been sweeping this floor for days.,5,3
JAQEN, Good.,5,3
ARYA, I didn't come here to sweep floors.,5,3
JAQEN," No? Why come, then?",5,3
ARYA, You said that I could be your apprentice. You said you'd teach me how to a Faceless Man.,5,3
JAQEN," A man teaches a girl. (Stands up). Valar dohaeris. All men must serve. Faceless men, most of all. (Walks away).",5,3
ARYA, I want to serve. (Jaqen stops).,5,3
JAQEN," A girl wants to serve herself. Here we serve the Many-Faced God, to serve well. A girl must become no-one.",5,3
ARYA, Which one is the Many-Faced God? I see the Stranger. I see the Drowned God. I see the Weirwood Face.,5,3
JAQEN, There is only one god. A girl knows his name. And all men know his gift.,5,3
ARYA, Where are they taking him?,5,3
CUT TO, KING’S LANDING,5,3
BYSTANDERS, Queen Margaery! Queen Margaery! Queen Margaery!,5,3
MARGAERY & TOMMEN," I am his/hers, and she/he is mine. From this day, until the end of my days.",5,3
TOMMEN, Did I hurt you?,5,3
MARGAERY, No. You were lovely.,5,3
TOMMEN, It all happened so fast.,5,3
MARGAERY, Yes. (Chuckles).,5,3
TOMMEN," I was scared maybe I hurt you, it sounded",5,3
MARGAERY," No, no, no. You're very sweet. The sweetest king who ever lived.",5,3
TOMMEN," This is what I want to do all day, every day for the rest of my life.",5,3
MARGAERY," Wouldn't that be glorious? (They laugh. Tommen leans in to kiss her). Shouldn't we rest a little while? Just to catch our breath, there's no rush, is there?",5,3
TOMMEN, Of course not. Are you hungry? Shall I have them bring you some cake or pomegranate juice?,5,3
MARGAERY," No, I'm fine. I just want you all to myself. I want to know everything there is to know about King Tommen First of His Name.",5,3
TOMMEN, King Tommen. It still sounds strange to me. Does Queen Margaery sound strange to you?,5,3
MARGAERY, So strange… Husband.,5,3
TOMMEN," Wife. (They laugh). Sometimes it feels odd. I'm the king, I've married the most beautiful woman in the world, (She chuckles), and it's all because my brother died.",5,3
MARGAERY," I understand. But it's not your fault, you know that, don't you? You mustn't feel guilty.",5,3
TOMMEN, I don't feel guilty. That's what's odd.,5,3
TOMMEN, Do you like to sail?,5,3
MARGAERY, (Sits up). I love to sail.,5,3
TOMMEN," I do, too.",5,3
MARGAERY," I think we're going to be very happy, you and I.",5,3
TOMMEN," I do, too.",5,3
MARGAERY," Living in a tower so high, it touches the clouds. Of course my grandmother couldn't wait to go home. The capital is not for everyone, I suppose. Does your mother like it here?",5,3
TOMMEN, I don't think so. She told me never to trust anyone in King's Landing.,5,3
MARGAERY, It's so wonderful to have her watching over you. A lioness guiding her cub. (Pours them some wine).,5,3
TOMMEN," Well, but I'm a man now.",5,3
MARGAERY, You are. And the king. (Hands him win). But you'll always be her baby-boy.,5,3
TOMMEN, I suppose.,5,3
MARGAERY," I adore how she has always been so generous with me, so kind. And the horror she's had to injure. (Sits down and begins to comb her hair). Losing her husband, her eldest child and her father. It's no wonder she's so protective of you. She'll never let you out of her sight.",5,3
CERSEI," You look very much in love. The first days of marriage are often so blissful. She's certainly very pretty, isn't she? Like a doll, she smiles quite a lot. Do you think she's intelligent? I can't quite tell. Not that it matters.",5,3
TOMMEN, Do you ever miss Casterly Rock?,5,3
CERSEI, There's nothing for me in Casterly Rock.,5,3
TOMMEN, That's where you grew up. (They stop). You always told me that you liked the people there better. You said that King's Landing smelled of horse dung and sour milk.,5,3
CERSEI, (Chuckles). Why are we speaking of Casterly Rock?,5,3
TOMMEN," The way that you talked about it, I always thought that you missed it. That you... That it was your real home.",5,3
CERSEI, This is my real home now. Where my family lives.,5,3
TOMMEN," I want you to be happy, mother.",5,3
CERSEI," I know that. I know you do, my sweet boy.",5,3
TOMMEN, But wouldn't you be happier in Casterly Rock?,5,3
MARGAERY," I said, ""Darling, surely 4 times is enough, are you trying to set a new record?"" (Laugher). And he said, ""Well, what is the record? I'm sure we can break it.""",5,3
MARGAERY, Mother! (Gets up and hugs Cersei). Welcome.,5,3
CERSEI, Don't you look lovely. Marriage agrees with you.,5,3
MARGAERY, Can we bring you anything to eat or drink? I wish we had some wine for you. It's a bit early in the day for us.,5,3
CERSEI," No, no. I, I can't stay. I just wanted to let you know if, there is ever anything I can do for you.",5,3
MARGAERY, You are very sweet.,5,3
CERSEI, Tommen seems quite taken with his new queen.,5,3
MARGAERY, I absolutely adore him. You raised a gallant young man. I'm forever grateful.,5,3
CERSEI, Good. Good. I'm glad to hear you're happy.,5,3
MARGAERY," Ecstatic. I really am. Exhausted, to be honest, but what can I expect, he is half lion, half stag. (Margaery’s friends laugh).",5,3
CERSEI, I'll leave you to it then. (Turns to leave).,5,3
MARGAERY," Oh, forgive me, I haven't been at Court for long, I get so confused. What's the proper way to address you now? Queen Mother or Dowager Queen?",5,3
CERSEI, There's no need for such formalities.,5,3
MARGAERY," In any event, judging from the King's enthusiasm, the Queen Mother will be a Queen Grandmother soon.",5,3
CERSEI, Won’t that be a lovely day.,5,3
MARGAERY, Can you imagine the celebrations? They'll ring the bells all day and night.,5,3
CERSEI, Remember. Anything you need.,5,3
CUT TO, WINTERFELL,5,3
ROOSE, We can't hold the North with terror alone.,5,3
RAMSAY, You can't hold the North if you let these lesser lords insult us.,5,3
ROOSE," I sent you there to collect taxes, not bodies.",5,3
RAMSAY," Lord Cerwyn refused to pay. Said the Warden of the North would always be a Stark, and he'd be damned if he kissed a traitor's boot.",5,3
ROOSE, He left you no choice.,5,3
RAMSAY," I flayed him living, along with his wife and brother. Made his son watch.",5,3
ROOSE, And?,5,3
RAMSAY, The new Lord Cerwyn paid his taxes.,5,3
ROOSE, (After a moment). I have something important to tell you. Stop eating and listen.,5,3
ROOSE, We don't have enough men to hold the North if the other Houses rise up against us. Do you understand that?,5,3
RAMSAY, Our pact with the Lannisters protects -,5,3
ROOSE," I had a pact with Tywin Lannister, and Tywin Lannister is dead. The remaining Lannisters are a thousand miles away dealing with that fact. They've never once in the history of the Seven Kingdoms sent their army this far north. If you think they will for us, you're a fool. We become a great house by entering in alliances with other houses, and parleying those alliances into greater power. The best way to forge a lasting alliance isn't by peeling a man's skin off. The best way is marriage. (Stands up). Now that you're a Bolton by royal decree, it's time you married a suitable bride. And as it happens, I found the perfect girl to solidify our hold in the North.",5,3
CUT TO, MOAT CAILIN,5,3
SANSA, That's Moat Cailin.,5,3
BAELISH," Yes. A bit shabby, isn't it? You've been here before.",5,3
SANSA," On our way down to King's Landing, with my father and Arya and… where are you taking me?",5,3
BAELISH, Home.,5,3
SANSA," The Boltons have Winterfell. (He nods). The marriage proposal, it wasn't for you?",5,3
BAELISH, (Shakes his head). No.,5,3
SANSA, Roose Bolton murdered my brother. He betrayed my family!,5,3
BAELISH, He did.,5,3
SANSA, He serves the Lannisters.,5,3
BAELISH, For now.,5,3
SANSA, I won't go.,5,3
BAELISH, Winterfell is your home.,5,3
SANSA, Not anymore.,5,3
BAELISH, Always. You're a Stark. Dyeing your hair doesn't change that. You're Sansa Stark. The eldest surviving child of Ned and Catelyn Stark. Your place is in the North.,5,3
SANSA, I can't marry him. You can't make me. He's a traitor. A murderer.,5,3
BAELISH," You're not marrying Roose Bolton. No, you'll be marrying his son and heir, Ramsay. One day he'll be Warden of the North and you will -",5,3
SANSA, No!,5,3
BAELISH, Sansa -,5,3
SANSA," No, you can't make me. I will starve myself. I will die before I have to go there.",5,3
BAELISH," (Grabbing her). I won't force you to do anything. Don't you know by now how much I care for you? Say the word and we turn the horses round, but listen to me. Listen. (Quietly). You've been running all your life. Terrible things happened to your family and you weep. You sit alone in a darkened room, mourning their fates. You've been a bystander to tragedy from the day they executed your father. Stop being a bystander, do you hear me? Stop running. There's no justice in the world. Not unless we make it. You loved your family. Avenge them.",5,3
PODRICK, How do we get through there?,5,3
BRIENNE, We don't. We go around. (She turns her horse and begins leaving).,5,3
PODRICK, It sets miles out of the way. We'll lose sight of them.,5,3
BRIENNE, Doesn't matter. I know where they're going.,5,3
BRIENNE, Aren't you getting a bit old to be a squire? How did you end up squiring for the Imp?,5,3
PODRICK, He hates that nickname.,5,3
BRIENNE," Well, he's not here to complain about it, is he?",5,3
PODRICK," I squired for a knight name Ser Lorimer during the War of the Five Kings. One night, he had a bit too much to drink. And he was famished, so he borrowed a ham.",5,3
BRIENNE, He borrowed it?,5,3
PODRICK," He wasn't a thief. He was drunk and hungry and he wasn't thinking. I was drunk too. He gave me half the ham. Next morning, one of the guards saw him passed out, under a wagon, with the ham bone still in his hand. They hanged the man afternoon. They tied the noose for me too, but, Lord Tywin heard my family name was Payne. So he pardoned me, and sent me to King's Landing to squire for his son.",5,3
BRIENNE, As punishment. For both of you.,5,3
PODRICK, It didn't seem that way. Lord Tyrion was always very good to me.,5,3
BRIENNE," (Walks away to get firewood). Yes, all of your lords were very kind to you. All except me. Sorry you have to squire such a nasty person.",5,3
PODRICK, I'm not sorry. You're the best fighter I've ever seen. You beat The Hound. I'm proud to be your squire.,5,3
BRIENNE, I'm sorry I'm always snapping at you.,5,3
PODRICK, If you wouldn't snap at me I wouldn't learn anything.,5,3
BRIENNE," You want to be a knight, Pod?",5,3
PODRICK, Yes.,5,3
BRIENNE," Starting tomorrow, we'll train with the sword twice a day, before we ride in the morning and after we camp for the evening. (Sits down). And I'm going to show you how to ride properly.",5,3
PODRICK, Thank you.,5,3
BRIENNE," I can't knight you, but I can teach you how to fight.",5,3
PODRICK, I suppose that's more important.,5,3
PODRICK," You weren't a knight, but you were a Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon, weren't you?",5,3
BRIENNE, I was.,5,3
PODRICK, Lord Tyrion said he was a good man.,5,3
BRIENNE, He was.,5,3
PODRICK, But how did you end up serving Renly?,5,3
BRIENNE," (After a few moments). When I was a girl, my father held a ball. I'm his only living child, so he wants to make a good match for me. He invited dozens of young lords to Tarth. I didn't want to go, but he dragged me to the ballroom. (Pauses). And it was wonderful. None of the boys noticed how mulish and tall I was. The shoved each other, and threatened to duel if they thought it was their turn to dance. And whispered in my ear how they wanted to marry me and take me back to their castles. (Smiles). My father smiled at me and I smiled at him. I'd never been so happy. (Her smile drops). Till I saw a few of the boys sniggering. And then they all started to laugh, they couldn't keep the game going any longer. They were toying with me. ‘Brienne the Beauty’, they called me. Great joke. And I realized I was the ugliest girl alive. A great lumbering beast. I tried to run away, but Renly Baratheon took me in his arms. “Don't let them see your tears,” he told me. “They’re nasty little shits. The nasty little shits aren't worth crying over.” He danced with me and none of the other boys could say a word. And he was the king's brother after all.",5,3
PODRICK, But wasn't he... Lord Tyrion said he was...,5,3
BRIENNE," Yes, Pod, he liked men, I'm not an idiot. He didn't love me, he didn't want me, he danced with me because he was kind and he wouldn't see me hurt. He saved me from being a joke. From that day until his last day. And I couldn't save him in return. Nothing's more hateful than failing to protect the one you love. One day, I will avenge King Renly.",5,3
PODRICK, But you said a shadow murdered him. How do you fight a shadow?,5,3
BRIENNE," A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon. I know it was Stannis. I know it in my heart. Stannis is a man, not a shadow. And a man can be killed.",5,3
CUT TO, CASTLE BLACK,5,3
STANNIS, Lord Commander.,5,3
JON, (Stands up). Your Grace.,5,3
STANNIS, (To Olly as he closes the door). I'd like to speak alone.,5,3
JON," Olly is my steward now, as I was Lord Commander Mormont's. I want him to attend my meetings, to learn from men with experience. One day, he might command.",5,3
STANNIS, Very well. (They all sit down). Have you considered my offer?,5,3
JON, I have. And I thank you for it. You do me great honor. All my life I wanted to be Jon Stark.,5,3
STANNIS, Say the word and you will be.,5,3
JON, But I have to refuse you. I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. My place is here.,5,3
STANNIS, I'm giving you a chance to avenge your family. To take back the castle where you grew up. To rule the North.,5,3
JON," I wish I could fight beside you. Believe me, I do. But I swore a sacred vow at the Godswood. I pledged my life to the Night's Watch.",5,3
STANNIS, You're as stubborn as your father. And as honorable.,5,3
JON, I can imagine no higher praise.,5,3
STANNIS," I didn't mean it as praise. Honor got your father killed. (Stands up). But if your mind’s made up, I won't try to persuade you.",5,3
JON," May I ask, Your Grace, how long you plan to stay at Castle Black?",5,3
STANNIS, Are you bored of us already?,5,3
JON, You saved us from Mance Rayder's army. We will never forget that. But it's a question of survival. The Night's Watch can't continue to feed your men and the wildling prisoners indefinitely. Winter is coming.,5,3
STANNIS, I know it. We march on Winterfell within the fortnight. Before the snows trap us here.,5,3
JON, And the wildlings?,5,3
STANNIS," They'd rather burn than fight for me, so be it. I leave their fate to you. You could execute them, that's the safest course. (After a moment). Or you could see if this Tormund fellow is more willing to compromise than Mance ever was. I assume the brothers of the Night's Watch would rather see the wildlings dead.",5,3
JON," Most of the brothers, yes. There's little love for the free folk here. (Olly stares at him).",5,3
STANNIS, You're the Lord Commander. Your decision.,5,3
STANNIS, You have many enemies in Castle Black. Have you considered sending Alliser Thorne elsewhere? Give him command of Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.,5,3
JON, I heard it was best to keep your enemies close.,5,3
STANNIS, Whoever said that didn't have many enemies.,5,3
DAVOS," He sees something in you. (Jon looks up). Might not be apparent from his tone, but it's the truth. He believes in you.",5,3
JON, I'm sorry I disappointed him.,5,3
DAVOS, The king is a complicated man. But he wants what's right for the Seven Kingdoms.,5,3
JON, As long as he's ruling them.,5,3
DAVOS, He's the one true king. He has the blood right to that throne.,5,3
JON, I’ve sworn to stay clear of the politics of the Seven Kingdoms.,5,3
DAVOS, Have you now? (Turning to Olly). How does the Night's Watch vow go again? I bet you've got it memorized since you got here.,5,3
OLLY, Night gathers and now my watch begins -,5,3
DAVOS," Not that bit, the bit at the end.",5,3
OLLY," I'm the sword in the darkness, the watcher on the walls, the shield that guards the realm of men. I pledge my life -",5,3
DAVOS," Wait, that's enough. “The shield that guards the realm of men.” That's what you swore to be. Now I'm not a learned man, but the best way of helping the most people might not be sitting in a frozen castle at the edge of the world. It just might mean wading in the muck, getting your boots dirty, and doing what needs to be doing.",5,3
JON, And what needs to be done?,5,3
DAVOS," As long as the Boltons rule the North, (Stands up), the North will suffer. Just one man's opinion.",5,3
CUT TO, BRAAVOS,5,3
ARYA, What do you want?,5,3
WAIF, Who are you?,5,3
ARYA, What?,5,3
WAIF," You, who walk in here with a coin you never earned, whose value you do not respect. (Stops and walks to Arya). Who are you?",5,3
ARYA," (After a moment, perks up). No one.",5,3
ARYA, Ow! Cunt!,5,3
WAIF," A lie, a sad little lie. Who are you?",5,3
ARYA," I told you, I'm no - (Gets hit again). Do that again and -",5,3
WAIF, Who are you?,5,3
ARYA, You're about to find out.,5,3
JAQEN, What are you doing?,5,3
WAIF, We were only playing. The game of faces.,5,3
JAQEN, A girl is not ready.,5,3
WAIF, Clearly not.,5,3
ARYA, (Stands up). I am ready.,5,3
JAQEN, For what? For whatever you want. To be a Faceless Man. To be no one.,5,3
JAQEN," Whose sword is that? It belongs to Arya Stark. Arya Stark's sword, Arya Stark's clothes, Arya Stark's stolen silver. A man wonders how is it that no one came to be surrounded by Arya Stark's things?",5,3
ARYA, What do we do with them after we wash them?,5,3
CUT TO, WINTERFELL,5,3
MAN, Open gates!,5,3
ROOSE," Lady Sansa, welcome.",5,3
SANSA, (Smiles). Lord Bolton.,5,3
ROOSE," May I introduce my son, (Stands aside), Ramsay Bolton?",5,3
RAMSAY," It's an honor to meet you, my Lady.",5,3
WOMAN, I'll bring you a bowl of hot water. You must want to wash.,5,3
SANSA, Thank you.,5,3
WOMAN," Welcome home, Lady Stark. (Quieter) The North remembers.",5,3
CUT TO, CASTLE BLACK,5,3
JON, Sam. (Sam looks up. Jon looks at Maester Aemon’s chair). Maester Aemon?,5,3
SAM, He apologizes for not being here. He's not feeling well.,5,3
JON," Take good care of him. (To the group). Brothers. As you all know too well, it's long past time to dig a new latrine pit. (Laughter. Jon looks at Alliser). First Builder Yarwyck and I have decided to appoint a latrine captain to oversee this crucial task. (Laughter. After a moment, he continues). Brian. Seems like a good job for a ginger.",5,3
JON," Ser Alliser. (Silence). You have more experience than any other soldier at Castle Black. You proved your valour many times over, while defending the Wall from the wildling attack. I name you First Ranger.",5,3
JON, Lord Janos. I'm giving you command of Greyguard.,5,3
JANOS, (Scoffs). Greyguard is a ruin.,5,3
JON," Yes, the fort is in a sorry state. Restore it as best you can. First Builder Yarwyck can spare ten of his -",5,3
JANOS, I was charged with the defense of King's Landing when you were soiling your swaddling clothes. Keep your ruin.,5,3
SAM," Alright, alright! Enough of that.",5,3
JON," You mistake me, my Lord. That was a command, not an offer. Pack your arms and armour, say your farewells, and ride for Greyguard.",5,3
JANOS," (Stands up, angrily shouts). I will not go meekly off to freeze and die! Give it to one of the fools who cast a stone for you. I will not have it. Do you hear me, boy? I will not have it!",5,3
JON, Are you refusing to obey my order?,5,3
JANOS, You can stick your order up your bastard arse.,5,3
JON, Take Lord Janos outside.,5,3
JON," Olly, bring me my sword.",5,3
JANOS," You cannot do this! Get your hands off me! (Everyone moves outside). Scum, all of you! If the boy thinks he can frighten me, he's mistaken, yes, very mistaken.",5,3
JANOS," A disgrace! I have friends, important friends in the capital! You'll see!",5,3
JON," If you have any last words, my Lord, now is the time.",5,3
JANOS," (Trembling). I was wrong. You're the Lord Commander! We all serve you. I'm sorry. Not only for this, for all I've done and said. I was wrong! (Jon brings his sword up). My Lord, please, mercy! Mercy! I'll go! I will! Please. I'm afraid. I've always been afraid.",5,3
CUT TO, KING’S LANDING,5,3
OLYVAR," You have served us well, my son.",5,3
HIGH SEPTON," Thank you, Father.",5,3
OLYVAR, Which of the Seven will you worship today?,5,3
HIGH SEPTON, The Maiden.,5,3
OLYVAR, Where is the Maiden?,5,3
HIGH SEPTON, And the Stranger.,5,3
OLYVAR," (Leaning forward). Two is extra, you realize?",5,3
HIGH SEPTON," Yes, yes.",5,3
OLYVAR, What are you doing? This establishment belong to Lord Petyr Baelish. You can't -,5,3
LANCEL, You have profaned our faith. The faith of our fathers and forefathers.,5,3
HIGH SEPTON, I am the High Septon of the -,5,3
LANCEL, (Grabs his neck). You are a sinner. And you shall be punished.,5,3
CROWD, Sinner! Sinner! Sinner!,5,3
MAN 1, Repent!,5,3
CROWD, Sinner! Sinner! Sinner! Sinner! Sinner! Sinner!,5,3
MAN 2, Shame on you!,5,3
CROWD, Sinner! Sinner!,5,3
HIGH SEPTON," (To Cersei) Your Grace, (To Pycelle), Grandmaester, (To Mace) Lord Tyrell, (To Qyburn), uh…",5,3
QYBURN, It doesn't matter. (Mace sits down).,5,3
HIGH SEPTON," As the High Septon of the Faith of the Seven I give voice to the will of the Gods and am their foremost servant in this world. An insult to me is an insult to the Gods. An assault on my person, is an assault on our very religion.",5,3
CERSEI, You were assaulted?,5,3
HIGH SEPTON," I was, by those fanatics who call themselves ‘sparrows’. They humiliated me, they they beat me, they left me naked and bleeding on the cobblestones. I am lucky to be alive.",5,3
QYBURN, I heard this all began in Littlefinger's brothel.,5,3
MACE," High Septon, this is a rather shocking thing to hear.",5,3
HIGH SEPTON," I tend to both the highest born, and the lowliest amongst us. Even prostitutes may earn the mercy of the Mother.",5,3
QYBURN, So you were administering to the needs of these devout prostitutes?,5,3
PYCELLE, A man's private affairs ought to stay private!,5,3
CERSEI," What do you want from us, High Septon?",5,3
HIGH SEPTON," Justice! I ask that you protect our Faith by arresting these criminals and throwing them in the black cells. I ask that you execute their leader, this so-called High Sparrow. He's a threat to everything we hold sacred. If he goes unpunished -",5,3
CERSEI, And where do I find this man? This High Sparrow?,5,3
MERYN," I don't think this is a good idea, Your Grace.",5,3
CERSEI," Nonsense, Ser Meryn. These are deeply religious people. (To a man at the bottom of some stairs). Where can I find the High Sparrow?",5,3
MAN 1, Seven blessings.,5,3
MAN 2, Thank you.,5,3
MAN 3, Just a little more...,5,3
WOMAN, Thank you ever so for the soup!,5,3
CERSEI, A young man said I would find the High Sparrow back here. Where is he?,5,3
HIGH SPARROW," High Sparrow? Sounds ridiculous, doesn't it? Like Lord Duckling, or King Turtle. (Laughs). So, it's meant to. We're often stuck with the names our enemies give to us. (Prepares soup for the next person in line). The notion that we are all equal in the eyes of Seven doesn't sit well with some, so they belittle me.",5,3
WOMAN 2, Seven blessings to you.,5,3
HIGH SPARROW," Seven blessings to you, my dear. It's only a name, quite an easy burden to wear. Far easier than hers. (Prepares soup for the next person in line).",5,3
CERSEI, Why no shoes?,5,3
HIGH SPARROW, Because I gave them away to someone who needed them more. We all do that. It stops us from forgetting what we really are.,5,3
CERSEI, Is that why you came to King's Landing? To remind everyone?,5,3
HIGH SPARROW," Everyone? I have a hard enough job reminding myself. Oh, I tell them no one's special. And they think I'm special for telling them so.",5,3
CERSEI, (Smiles). Perhaps they're right.,5,3
HIGH SPARROW," It would be comforting to believe that, wouldn't it? The Gods sent you here to tempt me? I hope not. I had assumed you'd only come here to arrest me. For that incident with the High Septon.",5,3
CERSEI," An unacceptable way to treat the chosen representative of the Gods in this world, wouldn't you say?",5,3
HIGH SPARROW," Hypocrisy is a boil. Lancing a is never pleasant. Although, they could have been more careful with the blade.",5,3
CERSEI," The High Septon came to speak to me today. He doesn't want me to arrest you, he wants me to execute you.",5,3
HIGH SPARROW, I wouldn't presume to know your thoughts on the matter.,5,3
CERSEI," (After a moment). My thoughts on the matter align with your own. The High Septon's behaviour was corrosive, as was his attitude. Having a man like that reside in the Sept eats away the Faith from the inside. So now he resides in the Red Keep's dungeons instead. (The High Sparrow looks up at her surprised). The Faith and the Crown are the two pillars that hold up this world. If one collapses, so does the other. We must do everything necessary to protect one another.",5,3
QYBURN, Your Grace.,5,3
CERSEI," Send a raven with this message to Littlefinger in the Eyrie, or wherever he's slithering about. (Hands him the letter).",5,3
QYBURN," At once, Your Grace. (Walks to his desk).",5,3
CERSEI, How's your work coming along?,5,3
QYBURN, Very well.,5,3
CERSEI, You've made progress?,5,3
QYBURN," More than I've expected. Still a way to go, but…",5,3
CERSEI," Very good. I'll leave you to it then. Make sure Littlefinger is clear on the meaning of the word ""immediately"".",5,3
QYBURN," Shh. Easy, friend.",5,3
CUT TO, WINTERFELL,5,3
RAMSAY, She really is lovely. I hope I can make her happy.,5,3
BAELISH, I hope so too. I've become quite fond of Lady Sansa during our travels together. She’s suffered enough.,5,3
RAMSAY, I'll never hurt her. You have my word.,5,3
BAELISH," I've heard very little about you. Which makes you quite a rare thing, as lords go.",5,3
RAMSAY, I haven't been a lord very long. I was a bastard.,5,3
ROOSE, (Approaching). And you're not anymore. Allow me a moment alone with Lord Baelish.,5,3
RAMSAY," Yes, father. And thank you, Lord Baelish. I'm forever in your debt. (Bows).",5,3
BAELISH, He seems pleased.,5,3
ROOSE, Shouldn't he be?,5,3
BAELISH," (They begin walking). I assure you she's still a virgin. Tyrion never consummated the marriage. By the law of the land, she's no man's wife. Inspect her, if you must.",5,3
ROOSE," I leave that to the brothel keeper. It's her name I need, not her virtue.",5,3
BAELISH, Then I have delivered everything I've promised.,5,3
ROOSE, And you prepared for the consequences. When the Lannisters hear I've wed Sansa Stark to Ramsay.,5,3
BAELISH," The Lannister name doesn't mean what it once did. Tywin is dead. He kept his house in power through sheer will. Without him, Jaime has one hand and no allies, Tommen is a soft boy, not a king to fear.",5,3
ROOSE, The Queen will be enraged.,5,3
BAELISH," Queen Margaery adores Sansa. Cersei is Queen Mother, a title whose importance wanes with each passing day.",5,3
ROOSE," And yet she still has friends. Men in important places, whom she can ask for favours. (They stop, and Roose holds up a letter). A message for you, from Cersei Lannister. A rider arrived from Eyrie, shortly before dawn. Apparently, she thinks you're still in the Vale.",5,3
BAELISH," A message for me, you say. Strange that the seal is broken.",5,3
ROOSE," I'm sure you understand my position, Lord Baelish. If you received word in the night from the Queen Mother, it does make me question our new alliance. The Lannisters made you one of the great lords of Westeros. Yet, here you are in the North, undermining them. Why gamble with your position?",5,3
BAELISH, Every ambitious move is a gamble. You gambled when you drove a dagger into Robb Stark's heart. It appears that your gamble paid off. You're Warden of the North.,5,3
ROOSE, I had Tywin Lannister backing. Who supports me now? You?,5,3
BAELISH," The Eyrie is mine. The last time the lords of the Eyrie formed an alliance with the lords of the North, they brought down the greatest dynasty this world has ever known. I'd like to borrow one of your birds. Cersei will expect a reply.",5,3
ROOSE, I'd like to read the reply.,5,3
CUT TO, VOLANTIS,5,3
TYRION, I have to get out of this wheelhouse.,5,3
VARYS, Volantis is a large city.,5,3
TYRION, I have to get out of this wheelhouse.,5,3
VARYS, The likelihood of you being spotted here increases a hundredfold.,5,3
TYRION," Mm, I have to get out of this wheelhouse.",5,3
VARYS, I'm not sure how many new ways I can find of saying this.,5,3
TYRION, (Walks over to him). I will not be of any use to Daenerys Targaryen if I lose my mind. I can't remember the last face I saw that wasn't yours.,5,3
VARYS, It's a perfectly good face.,5,3
TYRION, I'm losing my mind.,5,3
VARYS," If anyone recognizes you, you'll lose more than that.",5,3
TYRION," Look, we are thousands of miles from Westeros. (Pulls his hood up). What am I? (Varys shakes his head). One more drunk dwarf.",5,3
TYRION, Slaves.,5,3
VARYS, Yes. The Volantene masters are very organized. (Shot of a man with a fly tattooed onto his cheek). Flies for dung shovelers. (Shot of a man with a hammer tattooed onto his cheek). Hammers for builders. (Shot of a man inspecting women with tears tattooed onto their cheeks). Tears for whores. Lest they forget.,5,3
PRIESTESS, (Valyrian) Lord cast your light upon us.,5,3
CROWD," (Valyrian, in unison) Lord cast your light upon us.",5,3
PRIESTESS, (Valyrian) For the night is dark and full of terrors.,5,3
VARYS, (Aside) We should keep moving.,5,3
CROWD," (Valyrian, in unison) For the night is dark and full of terrors.",5,3
PRIESTESS, (Valyrian) I was once as you are now.,5,3
PRIESTESS," (Valyrian) Bought and sold, (Varys approaches Tyrion), scourged and branded...",5,3
TYRION, The only red priest we had in King's Landing was Thoros of Myr. This one's much better looking.,5,3
PRIESTESS, (Valyrian) The Lord of Light hears your voice. He hears the king as he hears the slave; he hears the Stone Men in their misery...,5,3
TYRION, Stone men. Good luck stopping this spread of grayscale with prayer. You'd have better luck dancing away the plague. (Varys shushes him worriedly).,5,3
PRIESTESS, (Valyrian) He has sent you a saviour! From the fire she was reborn to remake the world! The Dragon Queen!,5,3
TYRION, We're going to meet the Saviour! You should have told me. Who doesn't want to meet the Saviour?,5,3
TYRION, (Covering his face). Come on. Let's find a brothel.,5,3
MAN, (Valyrian) It’s good luck to rub a dwarf’s head.,5,3
TYRION, It's even better luck to suck a dwarf's cock.,5,3
TYRION," See? We blend right in. Just two more travellers, mad with lust.",5,3
VARYS, Thank you.,5,3
TYRION, Curious... hair. (She looks at him).,5,3
MAN, (Across the room). The mother of dragons!,5,3
TYRION, It appears you're not the only Targaryen supporter.,5,3
VARYS, Someone who inspires priests and whores is worth taking seriously.,5,3
MAN, What makes you worth that much?,5,3
BLONDE PROSTITUTE, I’m magic. (They laugh).,5,3
MAN, I bet you bloody are.,5,3
TYRION," Well, (Watches her kiss the man), she's taken.",5,3
VARYS, Where're you going?,5,3
TYRION, I need to speak to someone with hair.,5,3
TYRION, Hello?,5,3
BLACK HAIRED PROSTITUTE, Hello.,5,3
TYRION, You've got no drink.,5,3
BLACK HAIRED PROSTITUTE, You've got no money.,5,3
TYRION," Do I look like a man without money? (She looks at him incredulously). Never trust looks. Until quite recently, I was one of the richest men in the world. (She laughs). But who needs wealth when you can make a woman laugh? (Sits down). I always pay my debts, I'm well known for it.",5,3
BLACK HAIRED PROSTITUTE, You like her? They all like her. They all want to fuck a queen.,5,3
TYRION, That’s because they’ve never met a queen.,5,3
BLACK HAIRED PROSTITUTE, You're just saying that.,5,3
TYRION," You know how to spot a liar. If I could pick any girl here, I would pick you.",5,3
BLACK HAIRED PROSTITUTE, Why?,5,3
TYRION, Because you have a skeptical mind.,5,3
BLACK HAIRED PROSTITUTE," (Smiles). Alright, then. I'm warning you. We’re gonna have to wash you first.",5,3
BLACK HAIRED PROSTITUTE, Come on.,5,3
TYRION," (After a moment). I'm, I'm sorry, I can't.",5,3
BLACK HAIRED PROSTITUTE, Of course you can. You're shy.,5,3
TYRION, I'm not.,5,3
BLACK HAIRED PROSTITUTE, Have another drink.,5,3
TYRION," Gladly, but this, I can't do. Believe me, no one is more shocked than I am. I hope it passes. What will I do in my spare time? I’ll go for a piss, that’s a start.",5,3
TYRION," No need to worry, I was just - (Turns to see it’s not Varys, but Jorah). Oh, I thought you were someone else. Shows almost over. I'm sure the girls inside will be happy to oblige.",5,3
TYRION, You made some kind of mistake. Why don't you tell me what you think you are doing and -,5,3
JORAH, I'm taking you to the Queen.,5,3
CUT TO, EXT. BOAT,5,4
JAIME, Is that Estermont?,5,4
CAPTAIN," Tarth, Ser Jaime. (Shot of an island). The Sapphire Isle.",5,4
BRONN, Why are we on a merchant ship? Why no Lannister sails?,5,4
JAIME," This ship's sailing to Oldtown. We'll get off earlier, not far from Sunspear. Row ourselves to the Dornish shores in the night.",5,4
BRONN, You ever been to Dorne?,5,4
JAIME, No.,5,4
BRONN, I have. The Dornish are crazy. All they want to do is fight and fuck. Fuck and fight.,5,4
JAIME, You should be happy to go back. (Drinks some water).,5,4
BRONN," (Gets up, walking to his knife). There's nothing like a good fight to get you in the mood for fucking. (Pulls out his knife from the sandbag). And there's nothing like a fuck-mad Dornish girl to clear your head for the next fight. It's how the two work together. And we're gonna do a lot of fighting, I am sure. Well, I am. But I don't imagine we'll get to stick around for the rest. Not after we've kidnapped their princess.",5,4
JAIME," We are not kidnapping their princess. We are rescuing my niece, bringing her back to the family,",5,4
BRONN, (Incredulously) Your niece?,5,4
BRONN, I've been doing this sort of thing a long time. I'm good at it. (Sits down).,5,4
JAIME, That's why you're here.,5,4
BRONN," I know. Why are you here? Why not send 40 of me, or an army? Unlike most folks, you actually got one.",5,4
JAIME, Because I don't want to start a war.,5,4
BRONN, That still doesn't explain why you're doing it.,5,4
JAIME, It has to be me.,5,4
BRONN," (Gets up starts walking). If I'm putting something of a lit together, a one-handed man, (Grabs some rope and walks back), who happens to be one of the most recognizable faces in Westeros, is not -",5,4
JAIME, It has to be me.,5,4
BRONN," (Sheaths his sword). You set your brother free, didn't you? I bet your sister didn't like that.",5,4
JAIME, (Quietly) Varys set him free.,5,4
BRONN," Well, if you ever see the little fucker, (Lays down), give him my regards.",5,4
JAIME," He murdered my father. If I ever see him, I'll split him in two. And then I'll give him your regards.",5,4
CUT TO, KING’S LANDING,5,4
MACE, The Iron Bank has called one tenth of the Crown's debts. Given the expense of rebuilding the royal -,5,4
CERSEI, How much can the Crown afford?,5,4
MACE," With winter coming, half what they ask. Less.",5,4
CERSEI, You're the Master of Coin. How do we pay them?,5,4
MACE," Well, House Tyrell could front the gold, and the the Crown will pay us back in time, or I'll have words with my daughter.",5,4
CERSEI," You've already given us too much. (Gets up and walks to a window). No, we must arrange better terms with the Iron Bank.",5,4
MACE, Absolutely.,5,4
CERSEI, In person.,5,4
MACE," (After a moment, looks at her surprised). Me? (Qyburn smiles).",5,4
CERSEI," We must send an envoy to the Iron Bank, someone of importance, to show these bankers our respect. As the King's Master of Coin, I can think of no one more qualified.",5,4
MACE," I will be honored, Your Grace.",5,4
CERSEI, The King has expressed concern about his father-in-law's safety on this voyage. (Smiling). He's ordered Ser Meryn to personally lead your escort.,5,4
MACE, My very own Kingsguard? Please express -,5,4
CERSEI," Safe travels, Lord Tyrell.",5,4
MACE," (Raises his hands). Of course, of course, (Gathers his belongings, and then gets up). I'll give your regards to the Titan of Braavos.",5,4
PYCELLE, The Small Council grows smaller and smaller.,5,4
CERSEI, (Walking out). Not small enough.,5,4
CERSEI," May I offer you some wine, Your Holiness?",5,4
HIGH SPARROW, No. (Smiles).,5,4
CERSEI, The old High Septon would have asked the vintage. (Smiles).,5,4
HIGH SPARROW," I could say that our minds are temples to the Seven and should be kept pure. But the truth is, (Chuckles), I don't like the taste.",5,4
CERSEI, Hmm.,5,4
HIGH SPARROW, (After a moment). How may I serve?,5,4
CERSEI, All over Westeros we hear about septs being burned. Silent sisters raped. Bodies of holy men piled in the streets.,5,4
HIGH SPARROW," Wars teach people to obey the sword, not the Gods.",5,4
CERSEI," Perhaps the Gods need a sword of their own. (HS raises an eyebrow). In the days before the Targaryens, the Faith Militant dispensed the justice of the Seven.",5,4
HIGH SPARROW," Well, the Faith Militant was disarmed more than two centuries ago.",5,4
CERSEI," If I explain the holy purpose to my son, the king, I have no doubt he will sign a decree arming the believers you felt worthy.",5,4
HIGH SPARROW, An army that defends the bodies and souls of the common people.,5,4
CERSEI," An army and service to the Gods themselves. And to you, of course. As the chosen representative of the Seven.",5,4
HIGH SPARROW," An honor I never expected. Or indeed, ever wished for.",5,4
CERSEI," Which is why you were chosen. (HS smiles). You and I both know how the world works. Too often the wicked are the wealthiest, beyond the reach of justice. The king himself cannot always punish those who deserve it most.",5,4
HIGH SPARROW, All sinners are equal before the Gods.,5,4
CERSEI, (Smiles. Continues after a moment). What would you say if I told you we have a great sinner in our very midst? Shielded by gold and privilege.,5,4
HIGH SPARROW, May the Father judge him justly. (Smiles).,5,4
MERCHANT, Help me! Help me!,5,4
OLYVAR, (Angrily). This is Lord Petyr Baelish's establishment.,5,4
MILITANT, Cocksucker! (Man screams). Boy fucker! You barbaric filth! There's a special place in the Seventh Hell for your kind.,5,4
CLIENT," Please, please, I'll pay! I'll pay all of you.",5,4
MILITANT," (Pulls out a knife). Yes, you will! Seize him.",5,4
MILITANT, Seize him.,5,4
LORAS, Get your hands off of me.,5,4
LANCEL," Ser Loras of House Tyrell, you have broken the laws of Gods and men.",5,4
LORAS, Who do you think you are?,5,4
LANCEL, Justice. (Loras grunts and struggles).,5,4
MARGAERY, Why is my brother in a cell?,5,4
TOMMEN," I, I don't know. I, I didn't order it.",5,4
MARGAERY, We both know who did. (Walks away). You told me she was returning to Casterly Rock.,5,4
TOMMEN, (Standing up). Are you saying my mother is behind this?,5,4
MARGAERY, She's jealous you're not hers anymore. Arresting my brother is her revenge.,5,4
TOMMEN, Aren't you and mother getting along?,5,4
MARGAERY," (Scoffs). Oh, my sweet, sweet King. (Sits down). Do you have any affection for me at all?",5,4
TOMMEN, (Takes her hand). Of course I do. You're my Queen.,5,4
MARGAERY, I can't bear to think of my brother locked away in some grimy cell.,5,4
TOMMEN, I'll set him free for you.,5,4
MARGAERY, Do you promise?,5,4
TOMMEN, I demand that Ser Loras be freed now!,5,4
CERSEI, (Turns around). Did I arrest him?,5,4
TOMMEN," Well, no... But you armed the Faith Militant. You gave the High Sparrow an army.",5,4
CERSEI," I did. And your wife has every right to criticize. (Begins walking towards her desk). Can't allow fanatics to arrest the Queen's brother, no matter his perversions.",5,4
TOMMEN, Then can I tell Margaery you'll have Ser Loras released?,5,4
CERSEI," I told you I am not holding Ser Loras. You're the King. I'm sure if you speak to the High Sparrow, he'll release the poor boy.",5,4
KINGSGUARD, Halt!,5,4
MILITANT, His Holiness is praying. He will not be disturbed.,5,4
KINGSGUARD, Give the order and we'll tear out this rebel.,5,4
TOMMEN," You mean, kill them? Here, in the sept?",5,4
KINGSGUARD, You'll be sending them to meet the Gods that they love.,5,4
MAN 1, Bastard!,5,4
MAN 2, You're an abomination!,5,4
MAN 3, You're born of sin!,5,4
WOMAN, Filthy bastard!,5,4
TOMMEN, We'll find another way.,5,4
MAN 4, Abomination!,5,4
TOMMEN, My Queen?,5,4
TOMMEN, There was no way to free Ser Loras without violence.,5,4
MARGAERY," You're the King of the Andals, the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, the Protector of the Realm. And you let a band of fanatics imprison your brother by law.",5,4
TOMMEN, I'm going to speak to the High Sparrow.,5,4
MARGAERY, Are you? When?,5,4
TOMMEN, I--I don't know.,5,4
MARGAERY, You don't know?,5,4
TOMMEN, He was praying just now.,5,4
MARGAERY, (Walking out). I have to send word to Grandmother.,5,4
TOMMEN, Will you come back later? (Margaery stops).,5,4
MARGAERY," I need to be with my family, Your Grace. (Continues walking).",5,4

JON, (To some of the men sparring). Good.,5,4
STANNIS, Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.,5,4
SELYSE, A bastard by some tavern slut.,5,4
STANNIS," Perhaps, but that wasn't Ned Stark's way.",5,4
SELYSE, I should have given you a son.,5,4
STANNIS, Not your fault.,5,4
SELYSE, Whose then? (Looks at their daughter Shireen). I gave you nothing but weakness. (Turns back). And deformity. (Stannis shakes his head).,5,4
MELISANDRE, (Walking towards them). Those scars mean nothing to the Lord of Light.,5,4
SELYSE, My Lady.,5,4
MELISANDRE, Her father is the Lord's chosen King. And her father's blood runs through her veins.,5,4
MELISANDRE, You march on Winterfell soon?,5,4
STANNIS, We must. To beat the snows.,5,4
MELISANDRE, Once before you put your faith in Ser Davos and left me behind. I hope you won't make that mistake again.,5,4
STANNIS, I won't. I need you.,5,4
MELISANDRE," You only need faith, my King.",5,4
STANNIS," (Walking away). And you, my Lady, what do you need?",5,4
MELISANDRE, To serve my Lord.,5,4
SAM, Lord Ashford. (Jon signs). Lady Coalfield. (Jon signs). Lord Smallwood.,5,4
JON, Never even heard of these people.,5,4
SAM, They haven't heard of you either. (Jon signs). But we need men and they have some.,5,4
JON, And how many men does this Lord Maison have to send us?,5,4
SAM," (Chuckles, looking at the next letter). More than Lord Weebly.",5,4
JON, Not him.,5,4
SAM," I know, I'm sorry, but we need men and supplies. And Roose Bolton is the Warden of The North.",5,4
JON, He murdered my brother.,5,4
SAM, We swore to be the Watchers on the Wall. We can't watch the Wall with 50 men. And we can't get more men without help from the Warden of the North.,5,4
SAM," Apologies, my Lady.",5,4
MELISANDRE, Lord Commander.,5,4
JON, How can I help you?,5,4
MELISANDRE," Come with us when we ride south. (Walks forwards). None of us know the castle as well as you do. Its hidden tunnels, its weaknesses, its people. Winterfell was your home once. Don't you want to chase the rats out of it? (Turns to Jon).",5,4
JON, Castle Black is my home now. Night's Watch takes no part in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms.,5,4
MELISANDRE, There's only one war. Life against death. Come. Let me show what you're fighting for. (Walks in front of Jon).,5,4
JON," You're gonna show me some vision in the fire. Forgive me, my Lady. But I don't trust in visions.",5,4
MELISANDRE, No visions. No magic. Just life.,5,4
MELISANDRE," Do you feel my heart beating? This power in you, you resist it, and that's your mistake. Embrace it.",5,4
MELISANDRE," The Lord of Light made us male and female. Two parts of a greater whole. We are joining this power. Power to make life, power to make light, and power to cast shadows.",5,4
JON, I don't think Stannis would like that very much.,5,4
MELISANDRE, Then we shouldn't tell him. (Starts unbuttoning Jon’s coat).,5,4
JON, I can't.,5,4
MELISANDRE, Why?,5,4
JON, I swore a vow. (Melisandre looks at him incredulously). I loved another.,5,4
MELISANDRE, The dead don't need lovers. Only the living.,5,4
JON, I know. But I still love her.,5,4
MELISANDRE," You know nothing, Jon Snow.",5,4
STANNIS, Are you lonely?,5,4
SHIREEN," (Turns around, holding something). Just bored.",5,4
STANNIS, My father used to tell me that boredom indicates a lack of inner resources.,5,4
SHIREEN," (Looks up). Were you bored a lot, too?",5,4
STANNIS," I know Castle Black is no place for a child, but I -",5,4
SHIREEN, I like it. (Walks to a table). I thought I'd be left at home. I know mother didn't want to bring me. (Picks up an X from the table).,5,4
STANNIS, Why do you say that?,5,4
SHIREEN," She told me, ""I don't want to bring you.""",5,4
STANNIS, She shouldn't have said that.,5,4
SHIREEN," Are you ashamed of me, father?",5,4
STANNIS," When you were an infant, (Stands up and walks around his desk), the Dornish trailer landed on Dragonstone. His goods were junk except for one wooden doll. He'd even sewn a dress on it in the colors of our House. No doubt he'd heard of your birth, and assumed new fathers were easy targets. I still remember how you smiled when I put that doll in your cradle, (Shireen smiles), and you pressed it to your cheek. (Looks down. Shireen’s smile drops). By the time we burnt the doll, it was too late. (Walks to the table and adjusts the objects on it). I was told you would die. Or worse, the grayscale would go slow. (Turns to her). Let you grow just enough to know the world before taking it away from you. Everyone advised me to send you to the ruins of Valyria to live out your short life with the Stone men, before the sickness spread to the castle. I told them all to go to hell. (Shireen smiles). I called in every maester on this side of the world. Every healer, every apothecary. They stopped the disease and saved your life. Because you did not belong across the world with the bloody Stone men. (Walks towards her). You are the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon. And you are my daughter.",5,4
CUT TO, WINTERFELL,5,4
BAELISH, I thought I might find you here. (Sansa turns to him). Your Aunt Lyanna.,5,4
SANSA," Father never talked about her. Sometimes I'd find him down here, lighting the candles. They say she was beautiful.",5,4
BAELISH," I saw her once. I was a boy, living with your mother's family. Lord Whent had a great tourney at Harrenhal. Everyone was there. The Mad King, your father, Robert Baratheon. And Lyanna, she was already promised to Robert. You can imagine what it was like for me, a boy from nowhere, with nothing to his name, watching these legendary men, tilting at the lists. The last two riders were Barristan Selmy and Rhaegar Targaryen. When Rhaegar won, everyone cheered for the prince. I remember the girls laughing when he took off his helmet and they saw that silver hair. How handsome he was. Until he rode right past his wife, Elia Martell, and all the smiles died. I've never seen so many people so quiet. He rode past his wife, and he lay a crown of winter roses in Lyanna's lap. Blue as frost. How many tens of thousands had to die because Rhaegar chose your aunt?",5,4
SANSA," Yes, he chose her… and then he kidnapped her and raped her.",5,4
BAELISH, Come. (Takes her arm). Let's speak somewhere the dead can't hear us. (They begin walking away).,5,4
SANSA, Dressed for riding?,5,4
BAELISH, I am.,5,4
SANSA, Where are you going?,5,4
BAELISH, King's Landing.,5,4
SANSA, King's Landing?,5,4
BAELISH, Cersei sent for me. (They stop). We must not let her sniff out any trouble.,5,4
SANSA, You can't leave me here!,5,4
BAELISH," I know how hard it is to live with people you despise, believe me. But it won't be for long.",5,4
SANSA, How do you know?,5,4
BAELISH," (They begin walking again). Stannis Baratheon garrisons at Castle Black. He'll march south to King's Landing before the winter snows block his way. But first, he has to take Winterfell.",5,4
SANSA, You don't know that.,5,4
BAELISH," I do. Once he liberates these lands from the Boltons he'll rally your father's bannermen to his cause. With the North behind him, Stannis can finally take the Iron Throne.",5,4
SANSA, You think he'll defeat the Boltons?,5,4
BAELISH," He has a larger army. He's the finest military commander in Westeros. A betting man would put his money on Stannis. (They stop). As it happens, I am a betting man.",5,4
SANSA, And if you're right?,5,4
BAELISH," Stannis takes Winterfell, he rescues you from the most despised family in the North. Grateful for your late father's courageous support for his claim, he names you Wardeness of the North.",5,4
SANSA," But I, I wouldn't… Wardeness of the North",5,4
BAELISH, You are the last surviving Stark. He needs you.,5,4
SANSA," What if you're wrong? What if Stannis never attacks Winterfell, or he does and the Boltons defeat him?",5,4
BAELISH," Then you will take this Bolton boy, Ramsay, and make him yours.",5,4
SANSA, I don't know how to do that.,5,4
BAELISH, Of course you do. He's already fallen for you.,5,4
SANSA, His father frightens me.,5,4
BAELISH," He should, he's a dangerous man. But even the most dangerous men can be outmaneuvered. And you’ve learnt to maneuver from the very best. (Puts a hand on her shoulder). I return before too long. (Puts a hand behind her head). You'll be strong without me. (She nods, and he kisses her). The North will be yours. Do you believe me?",5,4
SANSA, I expect I'll be a married woman by the time you return.,5,4
CUT TO, DORNE,5,4
BRONN, Breakfast.,5,4
BRONN, That would have been a shit way to die.,5,4
JAIME," As far as I've seen, they're all shit ways to die.",5,4
BRONN, Aye. But your lot like to give the singers a good ending.,5,4
JAIME, I don't care what's sung about me when I'm dead.,5,4
BRONN," No? Two knights, off to rescue a princess. Sounds like a good song to me.",5,4
JAIME, Sounds like all the rest.,5,4
JAIME, What about you? What shit way would you choose?,5,4
BRONN," In my own keep, drinking my own wine, watching my sons grovel for my fortune.",5,4
JAIME, How disappointing. I thought you'd have something more exciting planned.,5,4
BRONN, I've had an exciting life. I want my death to be boring. How do you want to go?,5,4
JAIME, In the arms of the woman I love.,5,4
BRONN, She want the same thing?,5,4
JAIME, Let's go.,5,4
BRONN," The captain to that ship… What was he, Braavosi?",5,4
JAIME, Pentoshi.,5,4
BRONN, And he's headed to Oldtown?,5,4
JAIME, As I said. Why?,5,4
BRONN, What's to stop him from docking down the coast and telling the locals that Jaime Lannister's in Dorne?,5,4
JAIME, A bag of gold.,5,4
BRONN, I'm not sure you understand how much people hate your family in this part of the world.,5,4
JAIME, It was a heavy bag.,5,4
BRONN, And I bet he swore all kinds of oaths to get it. But you won't be around if he breaks them.,5,4
BRONN, How many you count?,5,4
JAIME, Four.,5,4
BRONN, How many you think you can take?,5,4
JAIME," One, if he's slow.",5,4
RIDER, Halt!,5,4
BRONN," Fucked in the arse. (Both get up). Hiya! (The riders approach them). Morning, lads. Glad we found you.",5,4
RIDER, Who are you?,5,4
BRONN, Cooper. (Points to Jaime). This is Darnell.,5,4
RIDER, You're from King's Landing.,5,4
BRONN, Accent gave me away? Flea Bottom. Whelped and whipped.,5,4
RIDER, Why are you here?,5,4
BRONN," Our ship capsized in the night. We managed to swim ashore. It was a near thing, really.",5,4
JAIME, I thought the sharks would get us. (Bronn looks at him).,5,4
RIDER, There are no sharks in Dorne.,5,4
JAIME, I could have sworn those were shark fins.,5,4
BRONN, Dolphins maybe.,5,4
RIDER, Throw your swords in the sand.,5,4
BRONN," Boys, there's no need for this. Just, point us in the right direction. We'll find our way home.",5,4
RIDER, Swords in the sand! Now!,5,4
BRONN, That one should be slow enough.,5,4
BRONN, Nice move! (Jaime turns to him).,5,4
JAIME, Luck.,5,4
BRONN, You had a wonderful teacher.,5,4
BRONN, Always wanted a Dornish stallion. Beasts can run a day and night without tiring. We'll ride to the Water Gardens with a nice breeze in our face.,5,4
JAIME, First we need to bury these bodies.,5,4
BRONN, Birds have to eat too.,5,4
JAIME," Corpses raise questions, questions raise armies. We're not here to start a war.",5,4
BRONN, Do you know how long it will take us to dig all those holes?,5,4
JAIME," (Holding out his hand). I can't dig very well with one hand. Not at all, really.",5,4
TYENE, Nama!,5,4
ELARIA," Nym, Obara.",5,4
OBARA, Will it be war?,5,4
ELARIA," Prince Doran will weep for your father, but nothing else. We must avenge Oberyn ourselves.",5,4
OBARA, Without Doran we have no army to march against the Lannisters.,5,4
ELARIA," We don't need an army to start a war. (Drinks water). Queen Cersei loves her children, and we have one of them.",5,4
NYMERIA, We may have a problem.,5,4
OBARA," A ship's captain, who found me in Planky Town, claiming he had information to sell. He told me he smuggled Jaime Lannister into Dorne.",5,4
ELARIA," He's come for Myrcella. If he gets to her before we do, we lose our only chance for revenge. You must choose. Doran's way and peace, or my way and war.",5,4
TYENE, (Walks towards her). I'm with you. Always. (Elaria puts a hand to her face).,5,4
ELARIA, Nym? (Nymeria nods). Obara?,5,4
OBARA," When I was a child, (Begins walking), Oberyn came to take me to court. I'd never seen this man, and yet he called himself my father. My mother wept, said I was too young, and a girl.",5,4
OBARA, (Smiles). I made my choice long ago.,5,4
CUT TO, EXT. BOAT AT SEA,5,4
TYRION, Thank you. (After a long pause). Who are you?,5,4
JORAH, Your captor.,5,4
TYRION, Do you have wine?,5,4
JORAH, No.,5,4
TYRION, I can't sleep without wine.,5,4
JORAH, Then stay awake.,5,4
TYRION, You're going the wrong way. My sister's in Westeros. Westeros is west! We're heading east.,5,4
JORAH, I'm not taking you to your sister.,5,4
TYRION, You said you were taking me to the Queen.,5,4
JORAH, I am. Queen Daenerys Targaryen. She's the Queen I serve.,5,4
TYRION, (Chuckles). What a waste of a good kidnapping. So happens I was heading there myself!,5,4
JORAH, What business would you have with the Queen?,5,4
TYRION," Gold and glory. Oh, and hate. If you've ever met my sister, you'd understand. So now that it's clear we're on the same side? (Holds out his hands expectantly. Jorah makes no move to respond). A high born knight from the North of Westeros, down on his luck in Essos. Dragon epaulettes? Bear sigil breast plate. You're Jorah Mormont. I have to ask how, exactly, were you serving your Queen in a whore house, half a world away? Is it possible, that you were running? Why would you be running? And why would she have sent you away? Oh, wait! You were spying on her, weren't you? It's all coming back to me! I was drunk through most of the Small Council meetings, but it's all coming back. You passed notes to Varys's little birds. She found out, didn't she? Found out, and exiled you. (Jorah looks downtrodden). And now you hope to win back her favor with a gift. A risky scheme. One might even say, desperate. Do you think Daenerys would execute me, and pardon you? I'd say the reverse is just as likely.",5,4
CUT TO, YUNKAI,5,4
DAENERYS, Everyone looks happy enough from up here. (Barristan chuckles). What?,5,4
BARRISTAN," I was thinking of all the times your brother made me go with him down from the Red Keep, into the streets of King's Landing.",5,4
DAENERYS, Why?,5,4
BARRISTAN," He liked to walk among the people, he liked to sing to them.",5,4
DAENERYS, He sang to them?,5,4
BARRISTAN, Yes. Rhaegar would take a spot on the Hook or the Street of Seeds and then he'd sing. Just like all the other minstrels.,5,4
DAENERYS, And what did you do?,5,4
BARRISTAN, I made sure no one killed him. And I collected the money. (Daenerys looks surprised). Well he liked to see how much he could make.,5,4
DAENERYS, He was good?,5,4
BARRISTAN, He was very good. Viserys never told you?,5,4
DAENERYS, He told me Rhaegar was good at killing people. (Sits down).,5,4
BARRISTAN, Rhaegar never liked killing. He loved singing.,5,4
DAENERYS, And what did you do with the money?,5,4
BARRISTAN," Well, one time, he gave it to the next minstrel down the street. One time, he gave it to an orphanage in Flea Bottom. One time... we got horribly drunk. (They both laugh).",5,4
DARIO," (Entering). Your Grace. Hizdahr is here, waiting in your audience chamber.",5,4
DAENERYS, How many others are there?,5,4
DARIO, Fifty a hundred.,5,4
DAENERYS," Will you be joining us, Ser Barristan?",5,4
DARIO, I think I can protect you from Hizdahr Zo Loraq.,5,4
DAENERYS," I think I can protect me from Hizdahr Zo Loraq. Go, Ser Barristan. Sing a song for me.",5,4
BARRISTAN, Your Grace. (Leaves).,5,4
HIZDAHR, All men must die. But not all can die in glory.,5,4
MISSANDEI, Glory?,5,4
HIZDAHR," Why else do men fight? Why did your ancestors cross the Narrow Sea and conquer the Seven Kingdoms? So their names would live on. Those who find victory in the fighting pits, will never become kings, but their names will live on. It's the best chance they'll ever have.",5,4
DAENERYS, Is that what you used to tell men before you set them to butchering each other for sport?,5,4
HIZDAHR," Your Grace, today is the traditional start of the fighting season.",5,4
DAENERYS, I do not recognize this tradition.,5,4
HIZDAHR," Traditions are the only thing that will hold this city, your city, together. (Shots of Sons of the Harpy walking through tunnels with torches). Without them, former slaves and former masters have nothing in common. Nothing but centuries of mistrust and resentment. I can't promise this is the answer to all our problems, but it's a start.",5,4
WOMAN, (Speaking another language) Sons of the Harpy.,5,4
HIZDAHR," I am so sorry, my queen. He was a good man.",5,5
DAENERYS," ""Barristan the Bold"" they called him. He crossed a continent to serve me. He was a loyal friend. And he died in an alley, butchered by cowards who hide behind masks.",5,5
DAARIO," We could pull back to the pyramid district, secure it, and use it as a base from which to operate. Then we clean the city out, neighborhood by neighborhood, street by street, until the rats have nowhere left to hide.",5,5
DAENERYS, I prefer your earlier suggestion. Round up the leaders of each of Meereen's great families and bring them to me.,5,5
HIZDAHR, But... I'm the leader of my family.,5,5
HIZDAHR," No, Your Grace! I had nothing to do with this. Your Grace!",5,5
DAENERYS, (in Valyrian) Walk forward.,5,5
MAN, (Valyrian) You cannot do this.,5,5
DAENERYS, (Valyrian) Another step.,5,5
DAENERYS," (Valyrian) They will eat you, if I tell them to. They may eat you even if I don’t. Children. Some say I should give up on them. (One of the men is mumbling). But a good mother never gives up on her children. She disciplines them if she must.",5,5
DAENERYS, (Valyrian) But she does not give up on them.,5,5
DAENERYS," (Valyrian) Who is innocent? Maybe all of you are, (Looks at Hizdahr), maybe none of you are. Maybe, (Touching Hizdahr’s arm), I should let the dragons decide.",5,5
HIZDAHR, (Valyrian) All men must die.,5,5
DAENERYS, Don't want to overfeed them. Tomorrow perhaps.,5,5
CUT TO, CASTLE BLACK,5,5
SAM," ""And though Daenerys maintains her grip on Slaver's Bay, forces rise against her from within and without. She refuses to leave until the freedom of the former slaves is secure."" She sounds like quite a woman.",5,5
AEMON," And she's alone, under siege, no family to guide her or protect her. Her last relation thousands of miles away, useless, dying.",5,5
SAM," Don't say that, Maester Aemon.",5,5
AEMON," A Targaryen, alone in the world, is a terrible thing.",5,5
JON, Maester Aemon.,5,5
AEMON, Lord Commander.,5,5
JON," Sam, I'd like to speak to the maester alone.",5,5
JON, How are you feeling?,5,5
AEMON," Oh, like a hundred-year-old man slowly freezing to death.",5,5
JON," I need your advice. There's something I want to do, something I have to do. But it'll divide the Night's Watch. Bitterly. Half the men will hate me the moment I give the order.",5,5
AEMON," Half the men hate you already, Lord Commander. Do it.",5,5
JON, But you don't know what it is.,5,5
AEMON," That doesn't matter. You do. You will find little joy in your command. But with luck, you will find the strength to do what needs to be done. Kill the boy, Jon Snow. Winter is almost upon us. Kill the boy, and let the man be born.",5,5
JON, Where are the rest of the free folk now? (Tormund scoffs). Where have they gone? (No response). Who leads them?,5,5
TORMUND, They followed Mance. They won't follow anyone else.,5,5
JON, What about you?,5,5
TORMUND, Hard to lead when you're in chains.,5,5
JON, What if I unchained you?,5,5
TORMUND, Why would you do that?,5,5
JON, Because you are not my enemy. And I'm not yours.,5,5
TORMUND, You sure seemed like my enemy when you were killing my friends.,5,5
JON," For 8,000 years the Night's Watch have sworn an oath to be the shield that guards the realms of men. And for 8,000 years we've fallen short of that oath. You belong to the realms of men. All of you.",5,5
TORMUND, And now everything is going to change?,5,5
JON, It is.,5,5
TORMUND, Why now?,5,5
JON," Because now, (Leans forward), I am Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.",5,5
TORMUND," What would you have me do, (Leans forward), Lord Commander?",5,5
JON, (Stands up). I'd have you go north of the Wall. Gather the remaining free folk wherever they are and bring them back here. I'll open the gates for them and let them through. I'll find them lands to settle south of the Wall.,5,5
TORMUND, They won't kneel for you and neither will I.,5,5
JON, I don't want them to kneel for me. I want them to fight with me when the time comes.,5,5
TORMUND, The day I ask my people to fight with the crows is the day my people cut my guts from my belly and make me eat them.,5,5
JON," And how many of your people can't fight? The women, the children, the old, the sick, what happens to them? You're condemning them to death. Worse than death because you're too proud to make peace. Or maybe you're not proud. Maybe you're just a coward.",5,5
TORMUND, (Stands up). Easy thing to say to a man in chains.,5,5
JON, Your people need a leader. And they need to get south of the Wall before it's too late. We don't have much time and they have less. The walkers are coming and they'll hit your people first. I'm not asking you to make peace to save your skin. Make peace to save your people.,5,5
TORMUND, Most of them are at Hardhome. You know where that is?,5,5
JON, Up on Storrold's Point. I can give you 10 horses and nine other men. You can get there in a week.,5,5
TORMUND, We'll need ships.,5,5
JON, I'll talk to King Stannis about lending you his fleet.,5,5
TORMUND," All right, then. You're coming with me. You're the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. They need to hear it from you. They need to know the ships they are boarding won’t be torched in the middle of the sea. You come with me, or I don't go.",5,5
MAN 1," You'd bring wildlings here, through our gates?",5,5
JON," Men, women, and children will die by the thousands if we do nothing.",5,5
MAN 1, Let them die. We got our own to worry about. Less enemies for us.,5,5
STANNIS, Fewer.,5,5
DAVOS, What?,5,5
STANNIS, Nothing.,5,5
SAM, (Standing up) There is good farmland in the Gift. (Laughter). Land that no one uses now. A dozen abandoned villages.,5,5
MAN 2, And why do you think the farmers abandoned those villages? Because the wildlings raided them for years. Cut them down! Just like they did this boy's people.,5,5
ALLISTER, We've been fighting them all for thousands of years. They've slaughtered villages. They've slaughtered our brothers.,5,5
JON, And we've slaughtered theirs.,5,5
EDD," I will follow you anywhere, you know that. But they killed Grenn. And they killed Pyp. (Men mumble in agreement). They killed 50 of our brothers. I can't forget that. I can't forgive it.",5,5
JON," You were at the Fist of the First Men. If we abandon them, you know what they become. We can learn to live with the wildlings or we can add them to the army of the dead. Whatever they are now, they're better than that.",5,5
JON," Thank you. (Olly walks away). Olly. (He stops). If you have something you want to say to me, say it. It's all right.",5,5
OLLY," You don't mean it, do you? Telling the wildlings you want to make peace. You're just doing it to trick them.",5,5
JON, It's not a trick.,5,5
OLLY," They burned my village. They put an arrow through my father's head right in front of me. They butchered my mother, everyone I ever knew.",5,5
JON, I know what it's like to lose the people you love. I know this is hard for you. But winter is coming. We know what's coming with it. We can't face it alone.,5,5
OLLY," Will there be anything else you need, Lord Commander?",5,5
JON, No.,5,5
CUT TO, WINTERFELL,5,5
PODRICK, She's far away from the Lannisters. This is her home. Maybe Lady Sansa is better off here.,5,5
BRIENNE, (Turns around). Better off with the Boltons who murdered her mother and brother? Sansa's in danger even if she doesn't realize it.,5,5
BRIENNE, Thank you. You've lived here a long time?,5,5
MAN, Aye.,5,5
BRIENNE, Did you know Lord Eddard?,5,5
MAN, I knew him and his father before him. The Starks are gone now.,5,5
BRIENNE, Not all of them. I know who's inside that castle.,5,5
MAN, Everyone knows. The Boltons.,5,5
BRIENNE, I'm not talking about the Boltons. I need to get a message to her. To Sansa Stark.,5,5
MAN, Who are you?,5,5
BRIENNE, Someone who swore to keep her safe.,5,5
MAN, Swore to who?,5,5
BRIENNE, Her mother.,5,5
MAN, Her mother's dead.,5,5
BRIENNE, That doesn't release me from an oath. I served Lady Catelyn. I serve her still. Who do you serve?,5,5
RAMSAY, Come back here. Myranda.,5,5
MYRANDA, I saw you staring at her.,5,5
RAMSAY, I'm going to marry her. That will involve looking at her from time to time.,5,5
MYRANDA, You said you'd marry me.,5,5
RAMSAY, And I meant it. When I was a bastard named Snow. But I'm a Bolton now. What I want is no longer the primary consideration. I'm furthering a dynasty.,5,5
MYRANDA, Do you think she's pretty?,5,5
RAMSAY, Of course I do. I'm not blind.,5,5
RAMSAY," You think she's pretty, too. I'm looking forward to our wedding night. But don't worry, I'll have plenty of time for you.",5,5
MYRANDA," Perhaps I'll marry, too.",5,5
RAMSAY," (Laughs). You're the kennel master's daughter. Who are you going to marry, the stable keeper's son? (She tries to hit him, but he restrains her). You're mine. You're not going anywhere. Unless I have to listen to more of your jealousy. Jealousy bores me. You remember what happens to people who bore me. You're not going to bore me, are you, Myranda?",5,5
MYRANDA, (Smiles). Never.,5,5
WOMAN," Beg pardon, my lady. I've come to refill the wash basin.",5,5
SANSA," Oh, I don't need-",5,5
WOMAN," (Closes the door). You still have friends in the North. If you're ever in trouble, light a candle in the highest window of the broken tower.",5,5
SANSA, But who -,5,5
WOMAN, You're not alone.,5,5
MYRANDA, I like your dress. Who made it for you?,5,5
SANSA, I made it myself.,5,5
MYRANDA, Really?,5,5
SANSA," Who, who are you?",5,5
MYRANDA," I'm Myranda, the kennel master's daughter. May I? (Takes Sansa’s arm and inspects her sleeve). Oh, wonderful. The stitching. Who taught you?",5,5
SANSA, My mother. (Pulls away).,5,5
MYRANDA, I'm sorry for what happened to her.,5,5
SANSA, Thank you.,5,5
MYRANDA," It's good that she taught you. It was a gift. Now every time you wear something you made, you can remember her.",5,5
SANSA, I'd rather have a mother.,5,5
MYRANDA," I know. It's not the same. Still, it's good to remember. Remember the way things were. I almost forgot. There's something else to help you remember.",5,5
MYRANDA, Down there at the end.,5,5
SANSA, What is it?,5,5
MYRANDA," That would spoil the surprise. Go ahead, it's perfectly safe. You won't believe it when you see it.",5,5
SANSA, Theon?,5,5
THEON, You shouldn't be here.,5,5
RAMSAY, You smell particularly ripe this evening. Pour me some wine.,5,5
RAMSAY, Do you have something to tell me?,5,5
THEON," No, my lord.",5,5
RAMSAY, Reek.,5,5
THEON, (Stuttering). She saw me.,5,5
RAMSAY, Who?,5,5
THEON, Sansa. Lady Sansa. She came to the kennels.,5,5
RAMSAY, She saw you?,5,5
THEON," Yes. I'm sorry, master. Forgive me. I didn't think -",5,5
RAMSAY, Come here.,5,5
RAMSAY," You mustn't keep secrets from me, Reek. Get on your knees.",5,5
RAMSAY, Give me your hand.,5,5
RAMSAY, I forgive you.,5,5
ROOSE," I trust you find your chamber suitable, my lady.",5,5
SANSA," Yes, thank you, my lord.",5,5
RAMSAY, Allow me.,5,5
RAMSAY, Mother.,5,5
WALDA," Thank you, Ramsay.",5,5
RAMSAY," My lady, we are all a family, we northerners. Our blood ties go back thousands of years. So I'd like to drink to our wedding. May our happiness spread from Moat Cailin to the Last Hearth.",5,5
ROOSE, (Raises his cup). To your wedding.,5,5
WALDA, (Raises her cup). To your wedding.,5,5
WALDA, It must be difficult for you being in a strange place.,5,5
SANSA, This isn't a strange place. This is my home. It's the people who are strange.,5,5
RAMSAY," You're right. Very strange. More wine, please.",5,5
RAMSAY," I heard you two had reunited. A fitting place for it. (Theon begins pouring wine). I like to imagine that the last time you spoke was in this very room. Are you still angry with him after he - what he did? Don't worry. The North remembers. I punished him for it. He's not ironborn anymore. Not Theon Greyjoy anymore. He's a new man. A new person, anyway. Aren't you, Reek?",5,5
THEON," (Turns around). Yes, master.",5,5
RAMSAY," That's his new name, Reek.",5,5
SANSA, Why are you doing this?,5,5
RAMSAY," Because Reek has something to say to you. Don't you, Reek? (He gestures Theon over). An apology. Apologize to Lady Sansa for what you did. Apologize for murdering her two brothers.",5,5
THEON," (After a moment, stuttering). I'm sorry.",5,5
RAMSAY," Look at her, Reek. An apology doesn't mean anything if you're not looking the person in the eye.",5,5
THEON, I'm sorry.,5,5
RAMSAY, Sorry about what?,5,5
THEON, For killing your brothers.,5,5
RAMSAY," There, over and done with. Doesn't everyone feel better? I do. That was getting very tense. Whew. (Theon turns to leave). You know what, my lady? What with him having murdered your brothers and the rest of your family gone Reek here is the nearest thing to living kin that you have left. Reek. You will give away the bride. Someone has to. What better person? Good? Good?",5,5
ROOSE," Yes, yes, very good.",5,5
RAMSAY, Wonderful. (Sips wine).,5,5
ROOSE," Walda and I have some good news as well, since we're all together.",5,5
WALDA, We're going to have a baby.,5,5
SANSA, I'm very happy for you.,5,5
ROOSE," From the way she's carrying, Maester Wolkan says it looks like a boy.",5,5
RAMSAY, How can you be sure?,5,5
ROOSE, Sure of what?,5,5
RAMSAY, That she's pregnant. I mean how can you tell?,5,5
ROOSE, Maester Wolkan has assured us beyond all doubt.,5,5
RAMSAY, So how did you manage it?,5,5
ROOSE, Manage what?,5,5
RAMSAY, Getting her pregnant.,5,5
ROOSE, I imagine you're familiar with the procedure.,5,5
RAMSAY," Of course, but how did you find it?",5,5
ROOSE," You disgraced yourself at dinner, parading that creature before the Stark girl.",5,5
RAMSAY, And if it's a boy?,5,5
ROOSE, You're worried about your position.,5,5
RAMSAY, My position is quite clear. I'm your son until a better alternative comes along.,5,5
ROOSE, You've never asked me about your mother.,5,5
RAMSAY," Why would I? She had me, she died. And here we are.",5,5
ROOSE," She was a peasant girl. Pretty in a common sort of way. She was the miller's wife. Apparently they had married without my knowledge or consent. So I had him hanged and I took her beneath the tree where he was swaying. She fought me the whole time. She was lucky I didn't hang her, too. A year later she came to my gates with a squalling baby in her arms. A baby she claimed was mine. I nearly had her whipped and the child thrown in the river. (Stands up). But then I looked at you and I saw then what I see now. You are my son. (After a moment). Stannis Baratheon has an army at Castle Black. But he won't stay for long. He wants the Iron Throne, and the road to King's Landing comes right through Winterfell. He means to take the North. But the North is ours. It's yours and mine. Will you help me defeat him?",5,5
RAMSAY, Yes.,5,5
CUT TO, CASTLE BLACK,5,5
GILLY, Is this every book there is?,5,5
SAM, Every book there is?,5,5
GILLY, In the world.,5,5
SAM," Well, no. There are thousands and thousands of books out there. This library is rather small, actually.",5,5
GILLY," Where you grew up, were there more books?",5,5
SAM, My father's not the most literate man. They say the Citadel has the largest library in the world.,5,5
GILLY, Where's that?,5,5
SAM, The Citadel? In Oldtown.,5,5
GILLY, I'm sorry I don't know things.,5,5
SAM," Gilly, look at me. You know how to do a hundred things I can never do. You can build a fire with wet wood. You can cook. You can stitch a wound.",5,5
GILLY, I can wash the linens. I can sweep the floor.,5,5
SAM, Well -,5,5
GILLY, Why does the Citadel have the biggest library?,5,5
SAM, It's where they train the maesters.,5,5
GILLY, Like Maester Aemon?,5,5
SAM," I wanted to be one when I was young. Instead, I became a man of the Night's Watch. Far more adventure up here anyway. I wouldn't have met you.",5,5
SAM," Ah, Your Grace.",5,5
STANNIS, You're Samwell Tarly?,5,5
SAM," I am, Your Grace.",5,5
STANNIS," Your father is Randyll Tarly. He defeated my brother at the Battle of Ashford. Only battle Robert ever lost. I told him he shouldn't go so far west so soon, but he never listened. Fine soldier, your father. You don't look like a soldier. But I'm told you killed a white walker.",5,5
SAM," I did, Your Grace.",5,5
STANNIS, How?,5,5
SAM, With a dagger made of dragonglass.,5,5
STANNIS, Dragonglass?,5,5
SAM, What the maesters call obsidian -,5,5
STANNIS, I know what it is. We have it in Dragonstone. Why would obsidian kill a walker?,5,5
SAM," I don't know. I've been going through all the old manuscripts hoping to find something, and all I've learned is that the children of the forest used to hunt with dragonglass.",5,5
STANNIS, The Lady Melisandre told me that death marches on the Wall.,5,5
SAM," I've seen it, Your Grace.",5,5
STANNIS, Seen what?,5,5
SAM, The army of the dead. And when they come -,5,5
STANNIS," We have to know how to fight them. (After a moment). Keep reading, Samwell Tarly.",5,5
STANNIS, It's time.,5,5
DAVOS," Uh, Your Grace. Wouldn't it be better to wait? When Jon Snow returns with the wildlings, we could have thousands more men.",5,5
STANNIS," If Jon Snow returns with the wildlings. We can't wait that long. We have the advantage, more men, more horses, all fed and rested. But every day we wait, the odds shift in Bolton's favor. This could turn to winter at any moment. We have to act now. Give the order. We march at sunrise.",5,5
DAVOS, I'll choose a dozen men to stay and guard the queen and the princess.,5,5
STANNIS," No need, they're coming with us.",5,5
DAVOS," It's a tough road ahead, Your Grace. Won't they be safer -",5,5
STANNIS," Here? Half these watchmen are killers and rapists. No, they march with us.",5,5
DAVOS," As you wish, Your Grace.",5,5
SHIREEN, (On horseback). Do you think Father will let me go down into the crypt?,5,5
DAVOS, Beg your pardon?,5,5
SHIREEN, At Winterfell. All the Kings in the North are buried there. Bran the Builder and King Dorren and-,5,5
DAVOS, First things first. It's a long march ahead. And then we have to take the castle.,5,5
SHIREEN, Is there going to be a battle?,5,5
DAVOS," Aye, princess, but you won't be anywhere near -",5,5
SELYSE," That's enough talk of battle, Ser Davos. You'll scare the child.",5,5
DAVOS," Yes, my queen.",5,5
SHIREEN, I'm not scared.,5,5
DAVOS," Well, I am. When the battle comes, promise you'll protect me.",5,5
SHIREEN, (Smiling). I promise.,5,5
STANNIS, I hope you know what you're doing with these wildlings. I need those ships.,5,5
JON," You'll get them back, I swear it. Have a safe journey, Your Grace. And thank you.",5,5
CUT TO, MEEREN,5,5
MISSANDEI, You're still too weak. (He lays back down).,5,5
GREY WORM, (Valyrian) How long have I been here?,5,5
MISSANDEI, (Valyrian) Three days.,5,5
GREY WORM, Ser Barristan?,5,5
GREY WORM," (Valyrian) I failed him. I failed my men, I failed my queen.",5,5
MISSANDEI," (Valyrian) You failed no one. You fought bravely. You’ll fight again. (In Common Tongue) Are you ashamed? You were ambushed, outnumbered. There was no way you could have known.",5,5
GREY WORM," This is not why. Wounded in war, there is no shame for this. I am ashamed because when the knife go in and I fall to the ground, I am afraid.",5,5
MISSANDEI, All men fear death.,5,5
GREY WORM," No, not death. I fear I never again see Missandei from the Island of Naath.",5,5
MISSANDEI, Now you have given the Masters what they deserve.,5,5
DAENERYS," If I give everyone what they deserve, I'll have no one left to rule. Ser Barristan counseled mercy when I took this city right up to the morning he died. Daario Naharis thinks I should kill the former Masters and let the rest of the city fend for itself. What do you think?",5,5
MISSANDEI," Your Grace, I think that I am not fit to have an opinion on these matters.",5,5
DAENERYS, (Sitting down). You are as fit as anyone I know. You know why I'm here. And you know who will suffer the most if this all falls apart. So what do you think?,5,5
MISSANDEI," I can only tell you what I have seen, Your Grace. (Sitting down). I have seen you listen to your counselors. I have seen you lean on their experience when your own was lacking and weigh the choices they put before you. And I have seen you ignore your counselors, because there was a better choice. One that only you could see.",5,5
HIZDAHR," My, my queen, please do not do this.",5,5
DAENERYS," What about ""Valar Morghulis""?",5,5
HIZDAHR, I did not want to die a coward. Apparently I do not want to die at all. (Sniffles).,5,5
DAENERYS," It takes courage to admit fear. And to admit a mistake. I came here to tell you that I was wrong. I was wrong and you were right. About tradition. About bringing the people of this city together. I will reopen the fighting pits. To free men only. Slavery will never return to Meereen, not while I live.",5,5
HIZDAHR," Yes, my queen.",5,5
DAENERYS," And in order to forge a lasting bond with the Meereenese people, I will marry the leader of an ancient family. (Hizdahr nods). Thankfully a suitor is already on his knees.",5,5
CUT TO, SEA,5,5
TYRION," Don't worry. I'll be fine. Nothing broken, I don't think. Where are we now? Not the Rhoyne. (No response). Long, sullen silences and an occasional punch in the face. The Mormont way. Let's start over. I apologize for before. My mouth sometimes runs away from me. This doesn't have to be an unpleasant trip. We're going to be spending a lot of time together on the way to Meereen.",5,5
JORAH, We are.,5,5
TYRION, What would make our time together truly enjoyable would be some wine.,5,5
JORAH, No wine.,5,5
TYRION," I am a person who drinks. People who drink need to keep drinking. Otherwise, they're not…",5,5
TYRION, I know where we are. You're taking us through Valyria.,5,5
JORAH, I am.,5,5
TYRION, Have you sailed this route before?,5,5
JORAH, No.,5,5
TYRION, You're going to bring Daenerys a souvenir from her ancestral homeland in case I'm not enough?,5,5
JORAH, I think you'll be plenty.,5,5
TYRION, You know what they say. The Doom still rules Valyria. What about the demons and the flames? Aren't you afraid of the Doom?,5,5
JORAH, No. But the pirates are.,5,5
TYRION, Oh.,5,5
TYRION, The Smoking Sea. How many centuries before we learn how to build cities like this again? Thousands of years the Valyrians were the best in the world at almost everything. And then -,5,5
JORAH, And then they weren't.,5,5
TYRION," And then they weren't. ""They held each other close and turned their backs upon the end. The hills that split asunder and the black that ate the skies; The flames that shot so high and hot that even dragons burned; Would never be the final sights that fell upon their eyes. A fly upon a wall, the waves the sea wind whipped and churned -""",5,5
JORAH," ""The city of a thousand years, and all that men had learned; The Doom consumed it all alike, and neither of them turned.""",5,5
TYRION, I would clap.,5,5
TYRION," I suppose this is it, then. This is what remains.",5,5
TYRION, What was that?,5,5
JORAH, Stone Men! Don't let them touch you!,5,5
JORAH, Get behind!,5,5
TYRION," Mormont, cut me free! (Jorah falls into the water). Mormont!",5,5
TYRION, Mormont! Mormont!,5,5
JORAH, (Faintly). Tyrion? Tyrion. Tyrion. Tyrion. You're all right.,5,5
JORAH, You're heavier than you look. Did any of them touch you?,5,5
TYRION," (Shakes his head). You? (Jorah shakes his head). I've seen greyscale before, but nothing like that.",5,5
JORAH, I suppose that's why they send them there.,5,5
TYRION," It'd be kinder to put daggers in their hearts and be done with it. (Jorah spits). Thank you for saving me. Of course, I wouldn't have needed saving if you hadn't kidnapped me in the first place. (Jorah gets up). So what now?",5,5
JORAH," We walk, up the coast. With luck, we'll find a fishing village. Maybe another boat.",5,5
TYRION, Without luck?,5,5
JORAH," We've got a long walk ahead of us. I'll get some wood for a fire. Try to get some rest, huh?",5,5
TYRION, That's the best idea you've had all day.,5,5
ARYA, What are they doing with the bodies?,5,6
WAIF, Get back to work.,5,6
ARYA, No! I’ve been here for weeks. I’m not scrubbing one more corpse until you tell me why I’m doing it.,5,6
WAIF, You will know why.,5,6
ARYA, When?,5,6
WAIF, When it’s time. Not before. Get back to work.,5,6
ARYA, When do I get to play the game?,5,6
WAIF, Game?,5,6
ARYA, The game. The game of faces.,5,6
WAIF, You tried already. You failed.,5,6
ARYA, I didn’t even know I was playing.,5,6
WAIF, Who are you?,5,6
ARYA, No one.,5,6
WAIF, Get back to work.,5,6
ARYA, Well who are you? What are you doing here? How’d you get here?,5,6
WAIF," I’m from Westeros. Just like you. Daughter of a Lord. Just like you. Except I was an only child. Heir to his fortune. My mother died. My father remarried and his new wife gave birth to a girl. My stepmother didn’t want any rivals for her precious daughter so she tried to kill me with poison. I found out, sought help from the Faceless Men and my father was widowed again. I’ve been serving them ever since.",5,6
WAIF, Was that true or a lie?,5,6
ARYA, What?,5,6
WAIF, Did you believe every word I said?,5,6
WAIF, Get back to work.,5,6
JAQEN, Who are you?,5,6
JAQEN, Who are you?,5,6
ARYA, Arya.,5,6
JAQEN, And where did you come from?,5,6
ARYA, Westeros. My family home is Winterfell. I’m the youngest daughter of a great lord. Eddard Stark. He died in battle.,5,6
JAQEN, A lie.,5,6
ARYA, After he was executed I fled the capital. Had to kill a stable boy. Drove my sword through his back.,5,6
JAQEN, A lie.,5,6
ARYA, I stabbed him in the gut. I tried to find my mother and brother. I never did. They were murdered by Walder Frey. An outlaw kidnapped me. A man called Polliver.,5,6
JAQEN, A lie.,5,6
ARYA," A man called the Hound. Sandor Clegane. He tried to sell me but was wounded in a fight. He begged me to kill him but I wouldn’t. I left him in the mountains to die. I wanted him to suffer, I hated him.",5,6
ARYA, I hated him.,5,6
ARYA, I hated him!,5,6
ARYA, That’s not a lie!,5,6
JAQEN, The girl lies. To me. To the Many Faced God. To herself. Does she truly want to be no one?,5,6
ARYA, Yes.,5,6
ARYA, I’m not playing this stupid game anymore!,5,6
JAQEN, We never stop playing.,5,6
TYRION," So, those villages we were supposed to find. We can’t live on berries and roots.",5,6
JORAH, I can.,5,6
TYRION, You’re not hungry?,5,6
JORAH, Of course I’m hungry.,5,6
TYRION," You’re an awful travelling companion, do you know that? Possibly the least charming man I have ever met.",5,6
JORAH, I am not your travelling companion.,5,6
TYRION, We are travelling together. In each other’s company. Therefore…,5,6
JORAH, Do you ever shut up?,5,6
TYRION, I sailed from King’s Landing to Pentos in a crate. Without ever saying a word.,5,6
JORAH, Why?,5,6
TYRION, Never occurred to you to ask why until now? You never wondered why Tyrion Lannister decided to visit a brothel in Volantis.,5,6
JORAH, I’m sure you’ve visited many brothels in many cities.,5,6
TYRION, I killed my father. He wanted to execute me for a crime I didn’t commit. And he was fucking the woman I loved.,5,6
TYRION," As miserable as you are, Mormont, at least your father was a good man.",5,6
JORAH, What do you know about my father?,5,6
TYRION," I met him. I visited the Wall. When I asked him about his men he knew all the stories, every one of them. He actually cared about the people in his command. How did they put it in the Watch? “We shall never see his like again.”",5,6
TYRION, You didn’t know. I’m sorry. I am.,5,6
JORAH, How?,5,6
TYRION, I only know what I heard,5,6
JORAH (stronger), How?,5,6
TYRION, He was leading an expedition beyond the wall. There was a mutiny. He was murdered by his own men.,5,6
JORAH, We better keep moving.,5,6
MAN, Valar morghulis.,5,6
ARYA, Valar dohaeris.,5,6
MAN, I have nowhere else to go. I’ve taken her to every healer in Braavos. I’ve spent every penny I had. She suffers every day of her life. I just want it to end.,5,6
GIRL, It hurts.,5,6
ARYA," I know. Don’t be afraid. I used to be like you. I was sick. I was dying. But my father never gave up on me. He loved me. More than anything in the world, just like your father loves you. So he brought me here. My father prayed to the many faced god. And I drank the water from this fountain. It healed me.",5,6
ARYA, I’ve devoted my life to him now. You don’t want to hurt anymore. Drink.,5,6
JAQEN," Is the girl ready to give up her ears, her nose, her tongue, her hopes and dreams, her loves and hates, all that makes a girl who she is, forever?",5,6
JAQEN, No. The girl is not ready to become no one. But she is ready to become someone else.,5,6
TYRION," Why Daenerys? Why is she worth all this? As I recall, the Mormonts fought against the Targaryens during Robert’s Rebellion.",5,6
JORAH, Do you believe in anything?,5,6
TYRION, I believe in many things.,5,6
JORAH," In something greater than ourselves, I mean. The Gods. Destiny. Do you believe there's a plan for this world?",5,6
TYRION, No.,5,6
JORAH," Neither did I. I was a cynic, just like you. Then I saw a girl step into a great fire with three stone eggs. When the fire burned out I thought I’d find her blackened bones. Instead I found her. Daenerys. Alive and unhurt. Holding her baby dragons. Have you ever heard baby dragons singing?",5,6
TYRION, No.,5,6
JORAH, It's hard to be a cynic after that.,5,6
TYRION, Doesn’t mean she’s going to be a great queen.,5,6
JORAH, No it doesn’t.,5,6
TYRION," The Targaryens are famously insane. What if she conquers the world? Then what? 1,000 years of peace and prosperity?",5,6
JORAH, First we have to conquer the world.,5,6
TYRION," We? Alright, let’s assume your dreams come true. She’s ecstatic when you bring her this enemy dwarf. She hacks off my head and restores your position. You command her army, sail to Westeros, defeat all your enemies, then watch as she climbs those steps and sits on the Iron Throne. Hurrah, long live the Queen. Then what?",5,6
JORAH, Then she rules.,5,6
TYRION, So a woman who has not spent a single day of her adult life in Westeros becomes the ruler of Westeros? That’s justice?,5,6
JORAH, She is the rightful heir.,5,6
TYRION," Why, because her father who burned living men for amusement was the king?",5,6
JORAH, Shh! It’s a slave ship,5,6
TYRION, Why is it anchored?,5,6
JORAH, They probably came ashore for--,5,6
MALKO, --water.,5,6
MALKO," Got a lot of fight in you, huh?",5,6
SLAVER, Salt mines.,5,6
MALKO, That or a galley slave. He looks strong enough.,5,6
SLAVER, What about the dwarf?,5,6
MALKO, Worthless. Cut his throat.,5,6
TYRION," Wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, let’s discuss this!",5,6
MALKO, And then chop off his cock. We can sell it for a fortune. A dwarf’s cock has magic powers.,5,6
TYRION," Wait, wait, wait, wait! You can’t just hand a dried cock to a merchant and expect him to pay for it. He has to know it came from a dwarf. And how could he know unless he sees the dwarf?",5,6
SLAVER, It will be a dwarf-sized cock.,5,6
TYRION, Guess again.,5,6
MALKO, The dwarf lives until we find a cock merchant.,5,6
JORAH, Queen Daenerys has outlawed slavery.,5,6
MALKO," We’re bound to Volantis, not Slaver’s Bay. Besides, she reopened the fighting pits. I never heard of free men fighting in the pits.",5,6
TYRION," The fighting puts in Mereen! You’re in luck then, you’re about to be rich. You are looking at one of the great warriors in the seven kingdoms.",5,6
TYRION, (looks at Jorah) Him.,5,6
MALKO, Him? He’s got to be 60 years old.,5,6
TYRION," Sure, he’s a bit long in the tooth, a bit withered, been in the sun too long. We can all see that. But he is a veteran of 100 battles. They wrote songs about him!",5,6
Malko, Is that true?,5,6
TYRION," He won the tournament at Lannisport, unseating Ser Jaime Lannister himself.",5,6
TYRION, The Kingslayer!,5,6
MALKO, Jousting. You’re talking about jousting. A fancy game for fancy lads. The men who fight at Mereen will swallow him whole.,5,6
JORAH, I killed a Dothraki blood rider in single combat.,5,6
MALKO, Liar.,5,6
JORAH," It’s no lie. His name was Qotho. He was bloodrider to Khal Drogo. Take me to Slaver’s Bay, put a sword in my hand, I’ll prove my worth.",5,6
LANCEL, Lord Baelish.,5,6
BAELISH, Yes? (Lancel approaches him) Lancel Lannister.,5,6
LANCEL, Brother Lancel. We abandoned our family names.,5,6
BAELISH, That’s quite a family to abandon.,5,6
LANCEL," The city has changed since you were here last. We flooded the gutters with wine, smashed the false idols, and sent the godless on the run.",5,6
BAELISH, Well done.,5,6
BAELISH, I’m here on urgent business for the Queen Mother. Should I send word that I’ll be delayed?,5,6
LANCEL," Step carefully, Lord Baelish. You’ll find that there’s little tolerance for flesh peddlers in the new King’s Landing.",5,6
BAELISH," We both peddle fantasies, Brother Lancel. Mine just happen to be entertaining.",5,6
BAELISH," Do you think it’s wise, your Grace, arresting the heir to Highgarden?",5,6
CERSEI, The Faith arrested the heir to Highgarden.,5,6
BAELISH, Of course. And the Faith were armed on your orders.,5,6
CERSEI, The King’s orders. Is the King to blame for Ser Loras’ perversion?,5,6
BAELISH, House Tyrell won’t tolerate these insults.,5,6
CERSEI," House Tyrell won’t tolerate it? I’m the insulted party, Lord Baelish. Ser Loras was promised to me, instead he chose the company of boys.",5,6
BAELISH, One’s choice of companion is a curious thing.,5,6
CERSEI, Most curious. Lysa Arryn for instance. A sorrily repellent woman. Forgive me. I know you’re still in mourning.,5,6
BAELISH, Lysa was a good woman. A kind woman.,5,6
CERSEI," She was neither of those things, we both know it. Still, I pity her son. How fortunate that the young Lord of the Vale has a new father to counsel him.",5,6
BAELISH, I know how hard it can be to lose both of your parents at such a young age.,5,6
CERSEI, If war comes to Westeros will the Knights of the Veil fight for their king?,5,6
BAELISH, Young Lord Robyn heeds my advice. And I have always counseled loyalty to the throne.,5,6
CERSEI, Good. (Cersei gets up) If there’s nothing else.,5,6
BAELISH," There is another matter, your Grace. Something so urgent I couldn’t trust the words to a raven. You once charged me with finding Arya Stark. To my shame I failed you. But I have found Sansa Stark. Alive, and well, and home again. In Winterfell.",5,6
CERSEI, That’s not possible.,5,6
BAELISH," My sources are well placed. They tell me Roose Bolton plans to marry her to his son, Ramsay, a bastard recently legitimized by King Tommen.",5,6
CERSEI, Roose Bolton is Warden of the North by the grace of my father.,5,6
BAELISH, Indeed. As reward for stabbing his own king in the heart.,5,6
CERSEI, We were fools to trust a turncloak.,5,6
BAELISH, Marrying his son to the last of the Starks gives him more legitimacy in the North than an alliance with a hated southern house.,5,6
CERSEI, I will skin him and his bastard like that wretch on that bloody sigil.,5,6
BAELISH," I would counsel patience, your grace.",5,6
CERSEI," Patience? Sansa helped murder my son, Roose Bolton is a traitor.",5,6
BAELISH," Stannis Baratheon is also a traitor, marching with his army on Winterfell. Let Stannis and Roose battle, let the enemies of the throne slaughter each other and when they’re done seize Winterfell from whichever thief survives.",5,6
CERSEI," Winterfell is 1,000 miles away from here. The weather has already begun to turn.",5,6
BAELISH," That is why it is critical to strike soon, while the victor still licks his wounds. Surely your Uncle Kevan could muster a force.",5,6
CERSEI, My Uncle Kevan has all the courage of a kitchen mouse.,5,6
BAELISH," Ser Jaime, then.",5,6
CERSEI, Jaime is away on a sensitive diplomatic mission. I’ve no idea when he’ll be back.,5,6
BAELISH," Perhaps I can help. The Knights of the Vale are some of the best fighters in Westeros, trained to battle in the ice and the snow.",5,6
CERSEI," Forgive me Lord Baelish, you have a reputation as a money lender and brothel keeper, not a military man.",5,6
BAELISH," You wouldn’t risk a single Lannister soldier or a single coin from the Royal Treasury. What do you have to lose, a brothel keeper?",5,6
CERSEI, And if you succeed?,5,6
BAELISH, Name me Warden of the North.,5,6
CERSEI, I’ll speak to the king this evening. Have him issue a royal decree.,5,6
BAELISH, I’ll not rest until the lion flies over Winterfell.,5,6
CERSEI, And I’ll l know you’re a man of your word when I see Sansa Stark’s head on a spike.,5,6
BAELISH, As I said. I live to serve.,5,6
TRYSTANE, I’m going to ask him tomorrow.,5,6
MYRCELLA, What if he says no?,5,6
TRYSTANE, He won’t. You’ve waited long enough. I want you to be my wife now. What is it?,5,6
MYRCELLA," Do you want to marry me because our families arranged it, or do you…",5,6
MYRCELLA, We can’t. Not yet.,5,6
TRYSTANE, Why not?,5,6
MYRCELLA, You know why not. Someone will see.,5,6
TRYSTANE, You are going to be my wife. I am going to be your husband. We are allowed to walk through the gardens together.,5,6
MYRCELLA, How many other girls have you walked through these gardens?,5,6
TRYSTANE, I like the way your eyes go squinty when you’re jealous.,5,6
MYRCELLA," They don’t go squinty, and you didnt answer the question.",5,6
DORAN, They make a lovely couple. A Lannister and a Martell. They have no idea how dangerous that is. We must protect them.,5,6
AREO," Yes, my prince.",5,6
DORAN, You have not had to use that axe of yours in a very long time. I hope you remember how.,5,6
AREO, I remember how.,5,6
BRONN (singing), The Dornishman’s wife was as fair as the sun and her kisses were warmer than spring. The Dornishman’s blade it was made of black steel and its kiss was a terrible thing. The Dornishman’s wife would sing as she bathed in a voice that was sweet as a peach...,5,6
JAIME," Alright, thats enough.",5,6
BRONN, I’m coming to the best part.,5,6
JAIME, We’re trying to blend in. We don’t want everyone in Dorne to hear your accent.,5,6
BRONN, This song really is all about the ending.,5,6
JAIME, It can wait. Up there.,5,6
JAIME, That’s the Water Gardens.,5,6
BRONN," Once we got the princess, then what?",5,6
JAIME, I like to improvise.,5,6
BRONN, That explains the golden hand.,5,6
ELLARIA," Unbowed, unbent, unbroken. For Oberyn.",5,6
SAND SNAKES, For Oberyn.,5,6
BRONN," Well, she’s made herself at home.",5,6
JAIME, Myrcella.,5,6
MYRCELLA," Uncle Jaime? I don’t understand, what are you doing here?",5,6
JAIME, Let’s speak in private.,5,6
TRYSTANE, I am Trystane Martell.,5,6
MYRCELLA, Trystane is my intended.,5,6
JAIME, Excellent. Good to meet you.,5,6
TRYSTANE," We weren’t expecting you, Ser Jaime.",5,6
BRONN," Why don’t you let them have some time alone, son?",5,6
BRONN, Let’s not do something stupid.,5,6
MYRCELLA, No!,5,6
BRONN, That was something stupid.,5,6
JAIME," We have to go, Myrcella, now.",5,6
MYRCELLA, You hurt him!,5,6
JAIME," You’ll be fine, I promise, but we have to--",5,6
BRONN, Oh for fuck’s sake.,5,6
OBARA, You’re coming with me.,5,6
MYRCELLA, I don’t want to!,5,6
OBARA," I wasn’t asking, princess.",5,6
AREO, Drop you weapons!,5,6
OBARA, I am Obara Sand. Daughter of Oberyn Martell. I fight for Dorne. Who do you fight for?,5,6
AREO, Drop your weapons!,5,6
AREO," When you were whole, it would have been a good fight.",5,6
BRONN (to Snake), You fight pretty good for a little girl.,5,6
RIDER, Halt!,5,6
OLENNA," Oh! You can smell the shit from 5 miles away. Well, why are we stopped, go on.",5,6
OLENNA," Rumors and gossip, that’s all they got. It’s theater, nothing more. If they arrested all the pillow biters in King’s Landing there’d be no room left in the dungeons for anyone else.",5,6
MARGAERY, Everyone knew about him and Renly.,5,6
OLENNA, Renly Baratheon shagged half the stable boys in the Seven Kingdoms. Everyone knew. No one cared.,5,6
MARGAERY, But he was the king’s brother.,5,6
OLENNA," And Loras is the queen’s brother. No, no, no, no, this is unacceptable.",5,6
MARGAERY, Cersei is behind this.,5,6
OLENNA," Of course she is. She wants to drag our names through the dirt. Put us in our place. Get some rest, dear, you look appalling. Let me deal with Cersei Lannister.",5,6
OLENNA," Your Grace, I have travelled a long way.",5,6
CERSEI, You must be exhausted.,5,6
OLENNA," Put the pen down, dear, we all know you aren’t writing anything.",5,6
CERSEI," Ah, yes, the famously tart-tongued queen of thorns.",5,6
OLENNA, And the famous tart Queen Cersei.,5,6
CERSEI, Beg your pardon.,5,6
OLENNA, I know you’re behind this absurd incarceration of my grandson.,5,6
CERSEI, If you apologize for that comment perhaps--,5,6
OLENNA, You’ll get your apology when I get Loras.,5,6
CERSEI, I was as shocked as anyone when The Faith arrested Ser Loras. I have no love for these fanatics. But what can the queen mother do?,5,6
OLENNA," Has the crown suddenly stopped needing the troops, gold, and wheat my house supplies?",5,6
CERSEI, I assure you our alliance with House Tyrell remains--,5,6
OLENNA, Do you expect the alliance to continue after you’ve thrown our future into prison?,5,6
CERSEI," As I said, i didn’t imprison anyone. As for your veiled threats--",5,6
OLENNA, What veil?,5,6
CERSEI, The Lannister-Tyrell alliance brought peace to a war-torn country. Do you really want to see the Seven Kingdoms slide back into warfare?,5,6
OLENNA, I didn’t trust your father. I didn’t particularly like him. But I respected him. He was no fool. He understood that sometimes we must work with our rivals rather than destroy them.,5,6
CERSEI," House Lannister has no rival. The High Septon has called for an inquest, not a trial. Just a small hearing to determine whether the charges against Loras have merit, which I’m sure they don’t. Loras will be freed, our happy alliance will continue, and we’ll forget this unfortunate conversation ever happened. Good day, Lady Olenna.",5,6
HIGH SPARROW, You are aware of the rumors concerning you and Renly?,5,6
LORAS, I don’t pay attention to rumors.,5,6
SPARROW," You were said to be despondent when he died. Witnesses said that you refused to leave his bedside, even as Stannis’ army closed in",5,6
LORAS, He was my friend. He was my king.,5,6
SPARROW," Wasn’t Joffrey your king? He was anointed by the 7, not Renly.",5,6
LORAS, I was wrong to support Renly’s claim. I know that. But I was forgiven by Joffrey. I fought for him at the Battle of the Blackwater.,5,6
SPARROW, Wearing Renly’s armor.,5,6
LORAS, Why does it matter what I wore?,5,6
SPARROW," Do you deny all of the charges against you? Fornication, buggery, blasphemy.",5,6
LORAS, Of course I deny them.,5,6
SPARROW, You never lay with Renly Baratheon.,5,6
LORAS, Never.,5,6
SPARROW, Nor any other man.,5,6
LORAS, Never.,5,6
SPARROW, That will be all Ser Loras.,5,6
OLENNA, Well I think that’s quite enough of that.,5,6
SPARROW, Faith calls Queen Margaery forward.,5,6
MARGAERY, You call me forward?,5,6
SPARROW, Yes. We have some questions for you.,5,6
MARGAERY, I am the queen.,5,6
SPARROW," You are. And according to Law of the Seven, neither kings nor queens are exempt from testimony at a holy inquest.",5,6
SPARROW, How do you respond to these charges against your brother?,5,6
MARGAERY, They are lies.,5,6
SPARROW, All of them?,5,6
MARGAERY, All of them.,5,6
SPARROW," Queen Margaery, in the presence of the gods, do you swear that your brother is innocent of these charges against him, to the best of your knowledge?",5,6
MARGAERY," Yes, I swear it.",5,6
SPARROW," Thank you, your grace.",5,6
SPARROW, Do you know this man?,5,6
OLYVAR," Yes, very well. He is Ser Loras Tyrell, heir to Highgarden.",5,6
SPARROW, How did you come to meet?,5,6
OLYVAR, I squired for him. He took a liking to me. He summoned me to his chamber the first day we met.,5,6
SPARROW, And what occurred in his chamber?,5,6
OLYVAR, We engaged in intimate relations.,5,6
SPARROW, You laid with him?,5,6
OLYVAR, That night and many others.,5,6
LORAS, Liar! He’s a liar!,5,6
SPARROW, Is there anyone else who can support your claim?,5,6
OLYVAR," Yes, yes, Queen Margaery. She walked in on us once not long ago. She didn’t seem surprised.",5,6
CERSEI, This testimony is an insult to a great house. Why should The Faith or anyone else take the word of a squire over the heir to Highgarden?,5,6
OLYVAR," He has a birthmark, your grace. Quite high on his thigh, wine-colored, and roughly the shape of Dorne.",5,6
LORAS, Liar!,5,6
OLENNA, What are you doing? Let us pass.,5,6
SPARROW, The Faith is satisfied that there is enough evidence to bring a formal trial for Ser Loras... and Queen Margaery.,5,6
MARGAERY, What?,5,6
SPARROW, Bearing false witness before the gods is as grave a sin as any. Take her.,5,6
MARGAERY, Tommen! Tommen!,5,6
MARGAERY," You can’t do this, I am the queen! Tommen, Tommen! I am your queen, how dare you!",5,6
SANSA, What do you want?,5,6
MYRANDA," Lord Ramsay sent me to draw your bath, my lady. You want to be clean and fresh for your new husband don’t you?",5,6
MYRANDA," You’re so beautiful. But if you need to keep him happy. Ramsay gets bored easily. You dont want to end up like... Well, like the others.",5,6
SANSA, What others?,5,6
MYRANDA, I shouldn’t gossip. It’s good to see the red again. No point in hiding anymore.,5,6
SANSA, What others?,5,6
MYRANDA," Let’s see. There was Kiera. The blacksmith’s daughter. She was tall. Like you. Lovely figure. But she talked and talked and talked and… Ramsay got tired of that. Then there was Violet. She had gorgeous blond hair. But she got pregnant and, well, that was boring. Then Tamsay. Such a sweet girl. Of course sweet girls get a bit dull after a while, don’t they? Ramsay let me come with him on that hunt.",5,6
SANSA, Hunt?,5,6
MYRANDA," Mm. Have you ever seen a body after the dogs have been at it? Not so pretty. But it’s your wedding day, why am I talking about such things?",5,6
SANSA, What was your name again?,5,6
MYRANDA, Myranda.,5,6
SANSA," And how long have you loved him, Myranda. Did you imagine that he would be with you forever, is that it? Then I came along and ruined it. I am Sansa Stark of Winterfell. This is my home and you can’t frighten me.",5,6
MYRANDA," Are you done with your bath, my lady?",5,6
SANSA, Go. I can finish on my own.,5,6
SANSA, Yes?,5,6
THEON," I’ve come to escort you to the Godswood, my lady. If you please, my lady, will you take my arm?",5,6
SANSA, No.,5,6
THEON," Lord Ramsay, he said I'm to take your arm.",5,6
SANSA, I’m not touching you.,5,6
THEON, Please. He’ll punish me.,5,6
SANSA, Do you think I care what he does to you.,5,6
ROOSE, Who comes before the Old Gods this night?,5,6
THEON," Sansa of the House Stark comes here to be wed. A woman grown, trueborn and noble. She comes to beg the blessings of the gods. Who comes to claim her?",5,6
RAMSAY, Ramsay of House Bolton. Heir to the Dreadfort and Winterfell. Who gives her?,5,6
THEON, Theon of House Greyjoy. Who was… who was her father’s ward.,5,6
ROOSE," Lady Sansa, will you take this man?",5,6
SANSA, I take this man.,5,6
RAMSAY, Are you pleased my lady?,5,6
RAMSAY, Good. I want you to be happy. My father said you’re still a virgin.,5,6
SANSA, Yes.,5,6
RAMSAY, Why? Why are you still a virgin? Afraid of dwarves?,5,6
SANSA," Lord Tyrion was kind, he was gentle, he never touched me.",5,6
RAMSAY, You’re not lying to me?,5,6
SANSA," No, my lord.",5,6
RAMSAY," Lying to your husband on his wedding night, that would be a very bad way to start a marriage. We are man and wife now, we should be honest with each other, don’t you think?",5,6
SANSA, Yes sir.,5,6
RAMSAY, Good. Now take off your clothes.,5,6
RAMSAY," Oh, no no no. You stay here Reek. You watch. (to Sansa) Do I need to ask a second time? I hate asking a second time.",5,6
RAMSAY, Reek? I told you to watch.,5,6
RAMSAY, You’ve known Sansa since she was a girl. Now watch her become a woman.,5,6
JON," First Ranger, you have command of Castle Black.",5,7
ALLISER," Lord Commander, it is my duty to tell you I believe this mission to be reckless, foolhardy, and an insult to all of the Brothers that have died fighting the wildlings.",5,7
JON," As always, thank you for your honesty.",5,7
SAM," Safe travels, Lord Commander.",5,7
JON," Thank you, Sam.",5,7
SAM," Oh, and…",5,7
SAM, It’s Dragonglass. It’s what I used to kill the White Walker. I hope you don’t need them.,5,7
JON, Me too.,5,7
AEMON, There he is. That laugh. Egg! Egg laughed like that. One of the first things I remember about him.,5,7
SAM," His little brother, Aegon. He became king.",5,7
AEMON," And before that, he was a jolly fellow. Like this one.",5,7
AEMON," Get him south, Gillyflower. Before it’s too late.",5,7
SANSA," Theon, wait.",5,7
THEON," Not Theon, my lady. Reek.",5,7
SANSA, Help me.,5,7
THEON, You’re his wife now.,5,7
SANSA, Theon,5,7
THEON, Do what he says. Do what he says or he’ll hurt you.,5,7
SANSA, He already hurts me every night. All day I’m locked in this room and every night he comes. It can’t be worse.,5,7
THEON, It can. It can always be worse.,5,7
SANSA, What did he do to you?,5,7
THEON, Please…,5,7
SANSA, You betrayed my family!,5,7
THEON, I’m sorry. I’m sorry!,5,7
SANSA, You have to help me!,5,7
THEON, He’ll see us. You don’t know him.,5,7
SANSA," My family still has friends in the North. All I have to do is give a signal and they’ll rescue me. Climb to the top of the Broken Tower, light this candle, and put it in the window. Promise me, Theon.",5,7
THEON," Reek, my lady, Reek!",5,7
SANSA," Your name is Theon Greyjoy. Last surviving son of Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands, do you hear me? Theon. Promise me.",5,7
RAMSAY," Yes, Reek?",5,7
AEMON, Egg! Egg! Mothers looking for you! Egg!,5,7
GILLY," Get some sleep, Sam. You’ll have to speak for him tomorrow.",5,7
SAM, You don’t know that.,5,7
GILLY, Get some sleep. I’ll watch over him.,5,7
SAM, I’ll stay too. He’s always been good to me. I can’t leave him now.,5,7
AEMON (panicked), Egg! Egg.. I dreamed... that I was old,5,7
SAM," His name was Aemon Targaryen. He came to us from King’s Landing, a Maester of the Citadel, chained and sworn. And a sworn brother of the Night’s Watch, ever faithful. No man was wiser or gentler or kinder. At the Wall a dozen Lord Commanders came and went during his years of service, but he was always there to counsel them. He was the blood of the dragon, but now his fire has gone out. And now his watch has ended.",5,7
BROTHERS, And now his watch has ended.,5,7
ALLISER," You’re losing all your friends, Tarly.",5,7
RAMSAY, My beautiful wife.,5,7
RAMSAY," When my father told me we were marrying I half expected a fat, bearded beast. Do you know how pleased I was when I saw you? You’ve made me very happy.",5,7
RAMSAY," Our scouts report that Stannis Baratheon rides for Winterfell. He’s a respected commander. His troops are loyal and battle tested. He’s hired thousands of foreign sell swords to bolster his army. But this storm was a stroke of luck for us northerners. Our people are used to fighting in frost. His army’s out there now, suffering in the snow. One day I’ll be Lord of Winterfell, and Warden of the North. You’ll be my Lady and Wardeness.",5,7
SANSA, But isn’t your step mother pregnant?,5,7
RAMSAY, What of it?,5,7
SANSA, What happens if she has a boy?,5,7
RAMSAY, Then I’ll have a baby brother.,5,7
SANSA, But he’ll be the heir.,5,7
RAMSAY, I’m Lord Bolton’s eldest son.,5,7
SANSA," But you’re a bastard, a true born will always have the stronger claim.",5,7
RAMSAY, I’ve been naturalized by a royal decree of--,5,7
SANSA, Tommen Baratheon. Another bastard.,5,7
RAMSAY," Bastards can rise high in the world. Like your half-brother Jon Snow. Born The Bastard of Winterfell, now the Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch.",5,7
RAMSAY," You didn’t know? Yes, he’s done very well for himself. Ah. I near forgot why I asked you to join me. Come, my lady.",5,7
RAMSAY, Your Northern friend. Reek told me you wanted to leave.,5,7
RAMSAY, Why? Winterfell is your home and I am your husband.,5,7
RAMSAY, Tough old bird. Everyone talks when I start beating them. But this one. Her heart gave out before I got to her face. We do breed them tough in the North. Bring my wife back to her chamber. It’s far too cold out here for a lady. You should hold on to your candles. The nights are so long now.,5,7
DAVOS, 40 horses died in the night. We’ll lose more come sunset. We’re running out of food. We can’t open the supply line until the snow clears.,5,7
STANNIS, What else?,5,7
DAVOS, The Stormcrows rode off last night.,5,7
STANNIS, 500 men.,5,7
STANNIS," Sell swords, loyal to nothing but gold.",5,7
DAVOS, We still have a hard march to Wintefell and we won’t be marching anywhere in this weather.,5,7
STANNIS, And?,5,7
DAVOS," This isn’t our time, we should head back to Castle Black when the snow clears.",5,7
STANNIS," I retreated from King’s Landing, Ser Davos. If I retreat again, I become “The King Who Ran.”",5,7
DAVOS, Your Grace..,5,7
STANNIS," Winter is coming. Those arent just the Stark words, it’s a fact. If we march back to Castle Black, we winter at Castle Black. And who can say how many years this winter will last.",5,7
DAVOS, It’s better to wait for the right time than to risk everything.,5,7
STANNIS," This is the right time, and I will risk everything. Because if I don't, we’ve lost. We march to victory or we march to defeat, but we go forward only forward,",5,7
DAVOS, Your Grace. (leaves),5,7
STANNIS (to Melisandre)," I’ve trusted in your visions, in your prophecies for years.",5,7
MELISANDRE," You saw it yourself, my king, when you stared into the flames. A great battle in the snow.",5,7
STANNIS, I don’t know what I saw.,5,7
MELISANDRE, You do know. Trust yourself.,5,7
STANNIS," And you, do you trust yourself?",5,7
MELISANDRE, I trust in the Lord.,5,7
STANNIS, Are you sure?,5,7
MELISANDRE, I have seen myself walk along the battlements of Wintefell. I have seen the flayed men banners lowered to the ground.,5,7
MELISANDRE, But sometimes sacrifices must be made to ensure victory. I have shown you the power of king's blood. The Usurper Robb Stark. The Usurper Joffrey Baratheon.,5,7
STANNIS, We don’t have Robert’s bastard here.,5,7
MELISANDRE," No, we have someone better, and your blood runs through her veins.",5,7
STANNIS, Have you lost your mind?,5,7
MELISANDRE, Do you doubt me still? After all that you’ve seen?,5,7
STANNIS, There must be another way. Leeches or something.,5,7
MELISANDRE, There is only one way. You must become king before the Long Night begins. Only you can lead the living against the dead. All your life has led us to this moment. To this decision.,5,7
STANNIS, She’s my daughter.,5,7
STANNIS, Get out.,5,7
DERRYK, The beauty from beyond The Wall.,5,7
BRAND," Where are you going, huh? Aren’t we better looking than the fat man?",5,7
DERRYK," The question is, is she pretty down south in the real world, or is she pretty because she’s the only girl here?",5,7
BRAND," Even in White Harbor, I’d want a kiss.",5,7
DERRYK," Come on love, give us a kiss.",5,7
GILLY, Leave me alone.,5,7
DERRYK, If you were my girl I wouldn’t leave you alone.,5,7
BRAND, One little kiss.,5,7
DERRYK," Come on, give him a kiss.",5,7
BRAND, A man gets lonely guarding the Wall.,5,7
BRAND, There’s no need to be rude.,5,7
DERRYK, We just want a little affection.,5,7
SAM, Get your hands off her. Brother Derryk. Brother Brand. I believe you both have guard duty tonight.,5,7
BRAND, Sam the Slayer. Are you gonna slay me with that sword?,5,7
DERRYK, Look at his hands shaking.,5,7
SAM," Gilly go on, Get back to your room and lock the door.",5,7
SAM, I’m warning you.,5,7
DERRYK, Come on! Come on!,5,7
DERRYK," You lying sack of shit! Killed a White Walker, eh? You fatass fuck. Come on, get up. (to Gilly) He’s your hero. He’s a hog!",5,7
GILLY, Leave him alone!,5,7
DERRYK, Stubborn little wilding bitch aren’t ya?,5,7
GILLY, Sam! Sam! Sam!,5,7
BRAND, Alright. Hold still.,5,7
SAM, I said get your hands off her.,5,7
BRAND, You’re gonna get yourself killed.,5,7
DERRYK, Roll over. Jon Snow’s not here to save you.,5,7
SAM, I killed a White Walker. I killed a Thenn. I’ll take my chances with you.,5,7
GILLY, Sam!,5,7
SAM, I’m alright.,5,7
GILLY, You’re not.,5,7
SAMMY, Just a bit woozy.,5,7
GILLY, The next time you see something like that you leave it alone.,5,7
SAM, I will not. They would’ve… I don’t know what they would have done,5,7
GILLY, I know they would have killed you if Ghost hadn’t come.,5,7
SAM, No. They were tiring out. I had them in the palm of my hand.,5,7
GILLY," Don’t be stupid Sam, you’re not a fighter.",5,7
SAM, What kind of man would I be if I ran away when I saw someone hurting you?,5,7
GILLY, Just promise me that whatever happens you’ll take care of little Sam.,5,7
SAM," Of course I will. And I’ll take care of you, too.",5,7
GILLY, I need more water.,5,7
SAM, Stay. Please.,5,7
GILLY, Am I hurting you?,5,7
GILLY, Are you sure?,5,7
SAM, Oh. Oh my.,5,7
MALKO," A rare find for the fighting pits, my friends. Not your usual street tough old drunken pirate. This one’s a Westerosi knight from an ancient house, trained in sword and lance. he fought beside the Stag King Robert on the far side of the Narrow Sea. He was first from the breach during the siege of Pyke, slaughtering 50 men with his flaming sword. He killed the great Khal Drogo in single combat. Betrayed by his woman, he sold himself into slavery to repay his debts. Bidding begins at 12 gold honors.",5,7
MALKO, 13. Do I have 14?,5,7
MALKO, 15? 15 golds honors. Do I have 16?,5,7
SLAVE BUYER, 20.,5,7
MALKO, Sold!,5,7
TYRION, Wait! You have to buy me as well.,5,7
BUYER, Why?,5,7
TYRION," We’re a team. I’m a great fighter, too.",5,7
MALKO, He’s funny. You have to give him that.,5,7
BUYER, Alright. He’s funny.,5,7
TYRION, Thank you my Lord. Thank you.,5,7
BUYER, Yes.,5,7
TYRION," My Lord, if I may. I’ve heard Mereen’s become a free city. You might run into trouble if you try to fight slaves in the fighting pits. Now if you were to fight free men who were paid a wage…",5,7
BUER," Here’s your wages, funny man. It’ll last the rest of your life.",5,7
DAARIO, How long before the king of Mereen comes to claim my pillow?,5,7
DAENERYS, Don’t be ridiculous. My marriage to Hizdahr is political. I think he’s smart enough to understand that.,5,7
DAARIO, I think the Sons of the Harpy have stopped killing because their leader was made king.,5,7
DAENERYS, Are you jealous?,5,7
DAARIO, Do you think I’m petty enough to speak ill of a man just because he represents competition?,5,7
DAENERYS, I do.,5,7
DAARIO, You’re right. My motivations are entirely impure.,5,7
DAARIO, Doesn’t make me wrong.,5,7
DAENERYS," You told me yourself, I can’t fight enemies within and without. So when enemies from without come knocking, I need the city of Mereen behind me. I have no choice.",5,7
DAARIO, Everyone has a choice. Even slaves have a choice. Death or slavery.,5,7
DAENERYS, So what else can I do?,5,7
DAARIO, Marry me instead.,5,7
DAENERYS," Even if I wanted to do such an inadviseable thing, I couldn’t.",5,7
DAARIO," Why not? You’re our queen, you can do as you like.",5,7
DAENERYS, No. I can’t,5,7
DAARIO, Then you are the only person in Mereen who’s not free.,5,7
DAARIO," I know I’m here to serve my queen and not to give advice, but can I make one more suggestion?",5,7
DAENERYS, Of course,5,7
DAARIO," On the day of the Great Games, gather all the great masters, and wise masters, and worthy masters you can find, and slaughter them all.",5,7
DAENERYS, I am a queen. Not a butcher.,5,7
DAARIO, All rulers are either butchers or meat.,5,7
OLENNA," You there! Where would I find the High Septon, or High Sparrow, or whatever bloody fool name he’s got.",5,7
HIGH SPARROW," It’s not as good a name as Queen of Thorns, I’ll admit.",5,7
OLENNA, You should have the decency to stand when you talk to a lady.,5,7
SPARROW, You should have the decency to kneel before the gods,5,7
OLENNA, Don’t spar with me little fellow.,5,7
SPARROW," For me, it’s the knees. You?",5,7
OLENNA, Hips.,5,7
SPARROW, Huh.,5,7
OLENNA," A man of the people, is that your game? It’s an old game. dull and unconvincing. A man of the people who does Cersei’s dirty work for her.",5,7
SPARROW, The people always do the dirty work.,5,7
OLENNA," Spare me the homilies, I can smell a fraud from a mile away.",5,7
SPARROW, A useful talent.,5,7
OLENNA, I’m here for my grandson and granddaughter.,5,7
SPARROW," Your grandson and granddaughter swore sacred vows and lied. The Father judges us all. Sons of high lords, sons of fishermen. If you break his laws you will be punished.",5,7
OLENNA, Don’t you walk away from me.,5,7
SPARROW," You don’t give commands here, Lady Olenna.",5,7
OLENNA, What is it you want? Gold? I’ll make you the richest septon who ever lived.,5,7
OLENNA, What then?,5,7
SPARROW," I imagine this is strange for you. Everyone you meet has a hidden motive, and you pride yourself on slitting in and out. But I’m telling you a simple truth: I serve the gods. The gods demand justice.",5,7
SPARROW," I imagine this is strange for you. Everyone you meet has a hidden motive, and you pride yourself on slitting in and out. But I’m telling you a simple truth: I serve the gods. The gods demand justice.",5,7
OLENNA, How do they communicate their demands? By raven or horse?,5,7
SPARROW, By the holy text. The seven pointed star. If you don’t have one in your library I’ll give you my own.,5,7
OLENNA (with contempt), I’ve read the seven pointed star.,5,7
SPARROW, Then you’ll remember the passages concerning buggery and perjury. Your grandchildren will be punished in the same manner as anyone who breaks the sacred laws.,5,7
OLENNA," Half the men, women, and children in this foul city break the sacred laws. You live among murderers, thieves, and rapists. And yet you punish Loras for shagging and Margaery for defending her brother?",5,7
SPARROW, Yes. The Gods’ laws must be applied to all equally.,5,7
OLENNA," If it’s equality you want then so be it. When House Tyrell stops sending our crops to the capital, everyone here will starve. And I’ll make sure the hungry know who to blame,",5,7
SPARROW," Have you ever served the field, Lady Olenna? Have you ever reaped the grain? Has anyone in House Tyrell? A lifetime of wealth and power has left you blind in one eye. You are the few. We are the many. And when the many stop fearing the few…",5,7
SQUIRE, Lady Olenna.,5,7
CERSEI," Starving yourself won't make things any better for her, my love.",5,7
TOMMEN, She’s in a prison cell and there’s nothing I can do. I am the king! The queen is in prison and there’s nothing I can do!,5,7
CERSEI," No matter who you are, no matter how strong you are, sooner or later, you'll face circumstances beyond your control.",5,7
TOMMEN, I’ll call in the army. I’ll take back the sept and kill every last one of them. I’ll start a war if I have to.,5,7
CERSEI, You know as well as I do who the first casualty in that war would be.,5,7
TOMMEN, I love her. I love her. I can’t help her.,5,7
CERSEI, We must be strong for those we love. We cannot give in to despair.,5,7
TOMMEN, I will speak to the high sparrow. There must be something--,5,7
CERSEI, Let me speak to him on your behalf. The king cannot dirty sully himself negotiating with an unwashed fanatic.,5,7
CERSEI, Your happiness is all I want in this world,5,7
TOMMEN, I know.,5,7
CERSEI," No you don’t. You can’t possibly. Not until you have children of your own. I would do anything for you. Anything to keep you from harm. I would burn cities to the ground. That is all that matters. You and your sister. From the moment you came into this world, my boy. My only boy.",5,7
AREO, Prince Doran hopes this satisfies your concerns about the princess’s wellbeing.,5,7
MYRCELLA, You looked different when I left. You had more hair.,5,7
JAIME, And more hands. How’s Trystane?,5,7
MYRCELLA, He’ll be alright.,5,7
JAIME, I’m sorry for that. It wasn’t supposed to happen that way.,5,7
MYRCELLA, Why is it happening at all?,5,7
JAIME, Your mother’s worried about you. Threats have been made. Dorne is too dangerous for you. I’ve come to take you home.,5,7
MYRCELLA," This is my home, this has been my home for years. I didn’t want to come here but she told me to. I did what she said, I did my duty and now she’s forcing me to go back?",5,7
JAIME, It's for your own good. These are complicated matters.,5,7
MYRCELLA," It’s not complicated at all, it’s simple. I love Trystane, I’m going to marry him, and we’re staying right here.",5,7
JAIME, I don’t understand.,5,7
MYRCELLA, Of course you don’t! You don’t know me!,5,7
BRONN (singing)," Brothers oh brothers, my days here are done, the Dornishman’s taken my life. Bur what does it matter, for all men must die, and I’ve tasted the Dornishman’s wife! Yes I’ve tasted the Dornishman’s wife!",5,7
TYENE, He’s got a good voice.,5,7
OBARA, We’re lucky he’s a singer. If he were a fighter we might have been in trouble.,5,7
BRONN, It’s against my code to hurt a woman.,5,7
OBARA, It’s amazing how many men we beat seem to have this code.,5,7
BRONN, I wouldn’t say you beat me.,5,7
TYENE, How’s your arm?,5,7
BRONN, Wonderful. Wouldn’t feel right to leave Dorne without a new scar.,5,7
TYENE, You think you’re leaving Dorne?,5,7
BRONN, No great hurry. Dornish women are the most beautiful women in the world.,5,7
TYENE, Thank you.,5,7
BRONN, I said Dornish women. I didn’t say you.,5,7
TYENE, I’m not the most beautiful woman you’ve ever seen?,5,7
BRONN, I’ve seen quite a few women in all the Seven Kingdoms.,5,7
TYENE, Name one more beautiful than I am.,5,7
BRONN," Well now, in King’s Landing there was an absolutely gorgeous...",5,7
TYENE, There was a what? In King’s Landing you were saying.,5,7
BRONN, Was I?,5,7
TYENE, There was a woman more beautiful than I am.,5,7
BRONN, Was there? My memory’s not what it was earlier.,5,7
TYENE, How’s your arm now?,5,7
BRONN, You seem concerned with it. You must really like me.,5,7
TYENE, And how about your head?,5,7
BRONN, My head… You don’t even wanna know what’s going on in…,5,7
TYENE, Your nose is bleeding.,5,7
BRONN, It’s nothing. It’s the dry air.,5,7
TYENE," My dagger was coated with a special ointment from Asshei. They call it the Long Farewell. It takes time to work, but if a single drop makes contact with the skin, death.",5,7
TYENE, The only antidote. Who’s the most beautiful woman in the world?,5,7
TYENE, Sorry? Who?,5,7
BRONN (finally), You.,5,7
TYENE, Don’t drop it.,5,7
TYENE, I think you’re very handsome as well.,5,7
BAELISH, I’m sorry about the locale.,5,7
OLENNA, No you’re not.,5,7
BAELISH, It felt like the safest place.,5,7
OLENNA," Not for your clientele, clearly.",5,7
BAELISH," It was an establishment like no other. The sheer range of appetites catered to, desires that didn’t exist until we invented them.",5,7
OLENNA," You’ve always been rather impressed with yourself, haven’t you?",5,7
BAELISH, The past is the past. The future is all that’s worth discussing. The future of House Tyrell.,5,7
OLENNA," Don’t pretend to have any concern for my house, my grandchildren, or me. I should have known you’d return to the capital once things started going wrong.",5,7
BAELISH, I promise you..,5,7
OLENNA," I promise you, Lord Baelish, that our fates are joined. Together we murdered a king. And if my house should fall, I would have nothing to hide. And if i should meet with some accident here at this broken little flesh market, they’ll never even find what’s left of you. So do you deny a part in all of this?",5,7
BAELISH, Cersei summoned me to King’s Landing. I dared not refuse her.,5,7
OLENNA, And what did she want?,5,7
BAELISH," A piece of info that she know that I had. Neither silence nor lies were an option. But I have other information of which she is unaware. And as you say, our interests are aligned. I have a gift for you.",5,7
OLENNA, What kind of gift?,5,7
BAELISH, The same kind I gave Cersei. A handsome young man.,5,7
SLAVE OWNER," Many worthy fighters have died trying to make it to the Great Games. When most of you worthless scum join them in death this afternoon it will represent a significant rise in your station. But if you happen to triumph here you will fight at the great pit of Daznak itself in front of the queen. So whatever happens, the gods have smiled upon you today. Today is the day your lives actually start to mean something.",5,7
OWNER (O.S.)," You and you, you, you two, you, you, and you.",5,7
OWNER, Valar morghulis.,5,7
MEN, Valar dohaeris.,5,7
OWNER, Prepare yourselves.,5,7
DAENERYS, Sitting through the great games will be bad enough.,5,7
HIZDAHR," For generations, in the days leading up to the great games, it has been customary for our ruler to make the rounds to the lower pits to pay the fighters there the honor of her presence.",5,7
OWNER, Move yourselves!,5,7
OWNER, Your Grace. Your Future Grace. You honor us all.,5,7
OWNER," “We fight and die for your glory, O glorious queen.”",5,7
MEN," “We fight and die for your glory, O glorious queen.”",5,7
DAENERYS, I think I’ve seen enough.,5,7
HIZDAHR," Your Grace, it’s a tradition for the queen to stay until the victor has emerged.",5,7
DAENERYS, I’ve sacrificed more than enough for your traditions.,5,7
TYRION, What are you doing?,5,7
DAENERYS, Get him out of my sight.,5,7
JORAH," Khaleesi, please, I just need a moment of your time. I brought you a gift.",5,7
TYRION (O.S.), It’s true. He has.,5,7
DAENERYS, Who are you?,5,7
TYRION," I am the gift. It’s a pleasure to meet you, Your Grace. My name is Tyrion Lannister.",5,7
CERSEI," This is horrible. Unacceptable. Are they feeding you enough at least? I brought you this. Venison. It’s quite good. I had it myself for supper only last night. We did everything we could from the moment they took your brother. Tommen even went to the sept himself to confront the high sparrow, but I fear The Faith has left reason behind.",5,7
MARGAERY, I know you did this.,5,7
CERSEI, We are making every effort on your behalf. I swear to you by all the seven gods.,5,7
MARGAERY," Lies come easily to you. Everyone knows that. But innocence, decency, concern? You’re not very good at those, I’m afraid. Perhaps that’s why your son was so eager to cast you aside for me.",5,7
CERSEI, You’re upset. You’re not thinking clearly. I’ll visit again when you’ve had a chance to calm down.,5,7
MARGAERY, I don’t want to see you again.,5,7
CERSEI," I do hope you change your mind about that. I’ve been told men often go mad in the Black Cells below the Red Keep, but I suppose your isolation will end once your trial begins.",5,7
MARGAERY, Leave.,5,7
CERSEI," Yes, I’m afraid I must. My son needs me now more than ever.",5,7
MARGAERY, Get out you hateful bitch!,5,7
CERSEI," Sleep well, sister.",5,7
HIGH SPARROW (to Sparrow), Thank you. (to Cersei) You saw her?,5,7
CERSEI, Yes.,5,7
SPARROW, And?,5,7
CERSEI, Her accommodations seem sufficient. What happens to her now?,5,7
SPARROW, Well she and her brother are both being held under fair suspicion. A trial will be held for each of them to determine if they are guilty of any acts that might constitute a violation of the tenants of the faith.,5,7
CERSEI, Who will stand judge?,5,7
SPARROW, Seven septons. As it was in all trials before the Targaryens.,5,7
CERSEI, Will you be one of them?,5,7
SPARROW, I will.,5,7
CERSEI, If one or both of them were to confess before the trial…,5,7
SPARROW, Then they will be at The Mother’s mercy.,5,7
CERSEI, What does The Mother’s mercy entail?,5,7
SPARROW," It depends on the situation. The acts themselves, the degree of contrition.",5,7
CERSEI, Thank you High Septon for bringing them whatever justice they deserve in the eyes of the Seven.,5,7
SPARROW, Did you know this chapel is one of the oldest structures in King’s Landing?,5,7
CERSEI, I think I may have heard at one point.,5,7
SPARROW, Baelor built his sept around it. But men worshipped here long before him.,5,7
SPARROW, Who carved this altar do you know?,5,7
CERSEI, I’m afraid i don’t.,5,7
SPARROW, No one does. There’s no name on it. Or anywhere else in the chapel. The people who built this place didn’t inflict their vanity on the people who came after them. The way Baelor did with that great gilded monstrosity out there. Their faith was clean.,5,7
SPARROW," A young man came to us not long ago, broken in body and spirit. He had so much to strip away, so much weighing him down. But piece by piece he unburdened himself. Let go of vanity, pride, sin, now his soul is so light he will float through the Seven Heaves like a bird.",5,7
SPARROW, And he has much to say about you.,5,7
CERSEI, Move. Let me go immediately.,5,7
CERSEI (O.S.), You will order her to let me go! I am the queen! I am the queen! Have you lost your mind? Let me go! You filthy… I am the queen! Let me go!,5,7
CERSEI, Look at me. Look at my face. It’s the last thing you’ll see before you die.,5,7
JORAH," Your Grace, I want to say--",5,8
DAENERYS, You will not speak. How do I know you are who you say you are?,5,8
TYRION, If only I were otherwise.,5,8
DAENERYS, If you are Tyrion Lannister why shouldn’t I kill you? To pay your family back for what it did to mine,5,8
TYRION, You want revenge against the Lannisters? I killed my mother Joanna Lannister the day I was born. I killed my father Tywin Lannister with a bow to the heart. I am the greatest Lannister killer of our time.,5,8
DAENERYS, So I should welcome you into my service because you murdered members of your own family?,5,8
TYRION, Into your service? Your Grace we have only just met. It’s too soon to know if you deserve my service.,5,8
DAENERYS, If you’d rather return to the fighting pits just say the word.,5,8
TYRION," When I was a young man I heard a story about a baby born during the worst storm in living memory. She had no wealth, no lands, no army, only a name and a handful of supporters, most of whom probably thought they could use that name to benefit themselves. They kept her alive, moving her from place to place, often hours ahead of the men who had been sent to kill her. She was eventually sold off to some warlord on the edge of the world and that appeared to be that. And then a few years later the most well informed person I knew told me that this girl without wealth, lands, or armies had somehow acquired all 3 in a very short span of time, along with three dragons. He thought she was our best, last chance to build a better world. I thought you were worth meeting at the very least.",5,8
DAENERYS, And why are you worth meeting? Why should I spend my time listening to you?,5,8
TYRION, Because you can not build a better world on your own. You have no one at your side who understands that land you want to rule. The strengths and the weaknesses of the houses that will either support or oppose you.,5,8
DAENERYS, I have a very large army and very large dragons.,5,8
TYRION, Killing and politics aren’t always the same thing. When I served as Hand of the King I did quite well with the latter considering the king in question preferred torturing animals to leading his people. I could do an even better job advising a ruler worth the name.,5,8
DAENERYS, So you want to advise me. Very well. (looks to Jorah) What would you have me do with him? I swore I would kill him if he ever returned.,5,8
TYRION, I know.,5,8
DAENERYS, Why should the people trust a queen who can’t keep her promises?,5,8
TYRION," Whomever Ser Jorah was when he started informing on you, he is no longer that man. I can’t remember seeing the same man as devoted to anything as he is to serving you. He claims he would kill for you and die for you, and nothing I have witnessed gives me reason to doubt him. And yet he did betray you.",5,8
TYRION, Did he have an opportunity to confess his betrayals?,5,8
DAENERYS," Yes, many opportunities.",5,8
TYRION, And did he?,5,8
DAENERYS, No. Not until forced to do so.,5,8
TYRION," He worships you. He is in love with you, I think. But he did not trust you with the truth - an unpleasant truth, to be sure - but one of great significance to you. He did not trust that you would be wise enough to forgive him.",5,8
DAENERYS, So I should kill him?,5,8
TYRION," A ruler who kills those that are devoted to her is not a ruler that inspires devotion. And you’re going to need to inspire devotion, and lots of it, if you’re ever going to rule across the Narrow Sea. But you cannot have him by your side when you do.",5,8
DAENERYS, Remove Ser Jorah from the city.,5,8
SEPTA, Confess.,5,8
CERSEI, My son. Let me speak to--,5,8
SEPTA, Confess. I meant it.,5,8
CERSEI, My face will be the last thing you see before--,5,8
ARYA," My name is Lana. I’m an orphan. When I was 8 I begged enough money to buy my first bucket of oysters, and I sold that bucket and made enough money to buy 2 more.",5,8
CUT TO, EXT. BRAAVOS - MARKET,5,8
ARYA (V.O.)," Iit took a while but I finally saved enough to buy myself an oyster cart. Now every morning I make my way down to the canals. I pass the fish mongers and the bakers. I usually see Lhara, my first customer of the day on my way home. Then I turn left onto Moonsinger Lane--",5,8
CUT TO, INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE,5,8
ARYA," Left onto Ragman Lane, where I do most of my trade.",5,8
JAQEN, Lana is very impressive. Very industrious. She will make a fine servant for the Many Faced God.,5,8
ARYA, How will she serve him?,5,8
JAQEN, She will no longer turn left onto Ragman Lane. She will turn right and go to Ragman Harbor.,5,8
ARYA, What will she do there?,5,8
JAQEN, She will see.,5,8
ARYA, See what?,5,8
JAQEN," How can a man tell a girl this. If he knew what she would see, there would be no reason to send her.",5,8
ARYA," Oysters, clams and cockles!",5,8
ARYA, Oysters clams and cockles! Oysters clams and cockles!,5,8
THIN MAN, Your oysters fresh?,5,8
ARYA, Best in the city.,5,8
THIN MAN, You wouldn’t lie to an old man would you?,5,8
THIN MAN, Very nice. Give me 4. With vinegar.,5,8
MAN, It’s my 18th voyage. I’ve returned from all of them without a scratch on me.,5,8
THIN MAN, Can’t do it.,5,8
MAN," Please I have 3 children. Without me-- here take it you have to, I have 3 children, what will they do? Please you have to! Please! You don’t understand?",5,8
CUT TO, INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE,5,8
JAQEN, The man is a gambler. He wages that his sailor's ship will make it to its destination. It is a strange wager for the captain. He only wins if he loses his life.,5,8
ARYA, So why would a captain make the wager in the first place?,5,8
JAQEN, A girl tells a man that she has seen.,5,8
ARYA," If the captain dies, the thin man pays his family a lot of money.",5,8
JAQEN," But perhaps the gambler loses his bet and decides that he doesn’t have to pay after all. A destitute woman and her small child, what can they do to such a man if he keeps their money for himself? To whom can they turn for recourse?",5,8
ARYA, The Many Faced God. You said you didn’t know what I would see at the docks.,5,8
JAQEN, A man had no idea what she would see and what she would not. A girl named Lana will return to the docks. She will watch the gambler. She will come to know as much about him as she knows about herself.,5,8
ARYA, And then what?,5,8
JAQEN, A gift for the Thin Man.,5,8
WAIF, She is not ready.,5,8
JAQEN," Perhaps she is, perhaps she’s not.",5,8
WAIF, And if she’s not?,5,8
JAQEN, It is all the same to the Many Faced God.,5,8
QYBURN, The trial will take place. The High Sparrow will be presenting a substantial case against you.,5,8
CERSEI, The charges?,5,8
QYBURN," Fornication, treason, incest, the murder of King Robert.",5,8
CERSEI, All lies.,5,8
QYBURN," Of course, Your Grace. My concern is that The Faith does not adhere to the same standards of proof as the crown. And I hope you’ll excuse me for saying it, but belief is so often the death of reason.",5,8
CERSEI, I wish you’d said it sooner. Any word from Jaime?,5,8
QYBURN," I’m afraid not. Your Grace, Grand Maester Pycelle has summoned your Uncle Kevan back from Casterly Rock to serve as Hand of the King. He now presides over the small council.",5,8
CERSEI, Tell him I need to speak to him.,5,8
QYBURN, I implored him to visit you but he would not.,5,8
CERSEI," What about my son, the king? If you can visit me then surely the king--",5,8
QYBURN," Your arrest, and Queen Margaery’s arrest, the king has not taken well. He remains in his chambers, his servants often find his food in the hall. Left untouched.",5,8
CERSEI," You need to talk to him, you need to talk to my son to come and see me, come and see his mother.",5,8
QYBURN," I tried my grace, he wouldn’t see me. He wouldn’t see anyone.",5,8
CERSEI, I can’t stay here.,5,8
QYBURN," There is a way, Your Grace. A way out.",5,8
CERSEI," Confess? To the High Sparrow? I won’t. I made him. I rose him up from nothing, I will not kneel before some barefooted commoner and beg his forgiveness.",5,8
QYBURN, Goodbye my queen. The work continues.,5,8
SANSA, Why. Why Theon.,5,8
THEON, Not Theon. There is no Theon. Reek.,5,8
SANSA," Reek. Why did you tell him, Reek?",5,8
THEON," I was helping you. You were trying to escape, there is no escape. Not ever. Theon Greyjoy tried to escape. The master knew. He knows everything. He hunted him, he caught him, he strapped him to a cross, and cut away piece after piece until there was no Theon left.",5,8
SANSA," Good. If it weren’t for you I’d still have a family. If I could do to you what Ramsay did to you right here, right now, I would.",5,8
THEON, I deserved everything. I deserve to be Reek. I did terrible things. Turned on Robb. Captured Winterfell. Killed those boys.,5,8
THEON," They weren’t “those boys”, they were Bran and Rickon. They were your brothers, you’d know them since they were born.",5,8
THEON, They weren’t. They were only--,5,8
SANSA, Only what?,5,8
THEON, I can’t..,5,8
SANSA, Tell me!,5,8
THEON," I can’t, not unless the master says...",5,8
SANSA," Tell me, they weren’t what?!",5,8
THEON, They weren’t...,5,8
THEON, They weren’t Bran and Rickon! I couldn’t find them. It was two farm boys. I killed them and burned them so no one would know.,5,8
SANSA, You didn’t…?,5,8
SANSA," Do you know where they went, Bran and Rickon?",5,8
THEON, I can’t talk to you anymore.,5,8
SANSA," Theon, you have to tell me, do you have any idea where Bran and Rickon--",5,8
THEON," Not Theon, Reek!",5,8
BOLTON BANNERMAN," Our scouts tells us he’s got no more than 6000 men. More than half of them are mounted, however.",5,8
ROOSE," And how high can Stannis’ horses jump? Our walls have been full repaired our walls have been reinforced. We have enough food for six months. We are more prepared for a siege than they could have ever been. All we have to do is wait for them to freeze, starve, and mutiny.",5,8
ROOSE, You disagree?,5,8
RAMSAY," Stannis isn’t from the North. You are, father. I think you’re missing an opportunity to show the people of the North how House Bolton treats southern invaders.",5,8
ROOSE, And what do you recommend?,5,8
RAMSAY," That we not sit and wait to let Stannis to decide what type of fight this is going to be. That we hit first, and hit hard, and leave a feast for the crows.",5,8
ROOSE, A smart commander does not surrender a defensive advantage. As long as we stay behind these walls they can’t touch us. Not to mention that the snow is so deep that we couldn’t get an army through if we wanted to.,5,8
RAMSAY, I don’t need an army. I need 20 good men.,5,8
DAENERYS, So have you decided yet? Whether I’m worthy of your service?,5,8
TYRION, Have you decided yet whether you’re going to have me killed?,5,8
DAENERYS, It’s probably my safest option.,5,8
TYRION, I can see why you would think so. It’s what your father would have done.,5,8
DAENERYS, And what would your father do?,5,8
TYRION, My father? Who publicly sentenced me to death? I’d say his thoughts on having me killed were abundantly clear.,5,8
DAENERYS, Is that why you killed him?,5,8
TYRION," Some day if you decide not to execute me, I’ll tell you all about why I killed my father. And on that day, should it ever come, we’ll need more wine than this.",5,8
DAENERYS, I know what my father was. What he did. I know the Mad King earned his name.,5,8
TYRION," So here we sit, two terrible children of two terrible fathers.",5,8
DAENERYS, I’m terrible?,5,8
TYRION, I’ve heard stories.,5,8
DANERYS, Why did you travel to the other side of the world to meet someone terrible?,5,8
TYRION, To see if you were the right kind of terrible.,5,8
DAENERYS, Which kind is that?,5,8
TYRION, The kind that prevents your people from being even more so.,5,8
DAENERYS, I did reopen the fighting pits. Under my rule murder will once again become entertainment.,5,8
TYRION," Yes, that was wise. And you agreed to marry someone you loathed for the greater good. Very impressive. My own sister married someone she loathed as well, though not by choice and certainly not for the greater good, Gods forbid. She ended up having him killed.",5,8
DAENERYS, Perhaps it won’t come to that.,5,8
TYRION, It’s not impossible that Varys was right about you after all.,5,8
DAENERYS, Varys? King Robert’s spy master?,5,8
TYRION, Yes. He was the one who convinced me to come find you. He was my travelling companion before Ser Jorah seized that role for himself.,5,8
DAENERYS, Jorah sent my secrets to Varys. For 20 years the spider oversaw the campaign to find and kill me.,5,8
TYRION, He did what he had to do to survive. He did a lot of other things that he didn’t have to do. I suspect he’s the main reason you weren’t slaughtered in your crib.,5,8
DAENERYS, But you trust him?,5,8
TYRION," Yes, oddly. He might be the only person in the world that I trust. Besides my brother.",5,8
DAENERYS, The brother who killed my father.,5,8
TYRION, That’s the one.,5,8
DAENERYS, Perhaps I will have you killed after all.,5,8
TYRION," Your queenly prerogative. I had given up on life until Varys convinced me you might be worth living for. You chop off my head? Well, my final days were interesting.",5,8
DAENERYS, I’m not going to kill you.,5,8
TYRION, No? Banish me?,5,8
DAENERYS, No.,5,8
TYRION," So if I’m not going to be murdered, and I’m not going to be banished...",5,8
DAENERYS, You’re going to advise me. (takes his wine cup) While you can still speak in complete sentences.,5,8
TYRION, Advise you on what?,5,8
DAENERYS, How to get what I want.,5,8
TYRION, The Iron Throne. Perhaps you should try wanting something else.,5,8
DAENERYS, If I want jokes I’ll get myself a proper fool.,5,8
TYRION, I’m not entirely joking. There’s more to the world than Westeros after all. How many hundreds of thousands of lives have you changed for the better here? Perhaps this is where you belong. Where you can do the most good.,5,8
DAENERYS, I fought so that no child born into Slaver’s Bay would ever know what it was like to be bought or sold. I will continue that fight here and beyond. But this is not my home.,5,8
TYRION," And when you get back to your home, who supports you?",5,8
DAENERYS, The common people.,5,8
TYRION," Let’s be generous and assume that’s going to happen. Here in Slaver’s Bay you had the support of the common people and only the common people. What was that like, ruling without the rich? House Targaryen is gone, not a single person who shares your blood is alive to support you. The Starks are gone as well, our two terrible fathers saw to that. The remaining Lannisters won’t back you, not ever. Stannis Baratheon won’t back you either, his entire claim to the Throne depends on the illegitimacy of yours. That leaves the Tyrells. Not impossible, but not enough.",5,8
DAENERYS," Lannister, Targaryen, Baratheon, Stark, Tyrell. They’re all just spokes on a wheel. This one's on top, then that ones on top and on and on it spins, crushing the people on the ground.",5,8
TYRION, It’s a beautiful dream. Stopping the wheel. You’re not the first person to have dreamt it.,5,8
DAENERYS, I’m not going to stop the wheel. I’m going to break the wheel.,5,8
JORAH, You said whoever wins would fight at the Great Pit in front of the queen. I won.,5,8
MASTER, You struck me.,5,8
JORAH, I’ve been flogged if it makes you happy. I’m the best you’ve got. If I win at the Great Pit how much can you sell me for?,5,8
MASTER," You’re a free man, you could have gone anywhere, why did you come back?",5,8
JORAH, Let me fight for her and I belong to you.,5,8
SEPTA, Thirsty? Confess.,5,8
CERSEI," I’ll get out of here, you realize. Before long.",5,8
SEPTA, Confess.,5,8
CERSEI, I can make you a wealthy woman. A lady of the court.,5,8
SEPTA, Confess.,5,8
CERSEI," I can make sure you die in the most hideous way imaginable, and all I do is sit here imagining ways for you to die.",5,8
GILLY, Does it hurt?,5,8
SAM, No.,5,8
GILLY, Good.,5,8
SAM, How are you?,5,8
GILLY, I’m not the one who got punched and kicked in the face.,5,8
SAM, You know what I mean.,5,8
GILLY, I’m good.,5,8
SAM, Are you scared?,5,8
GILLY, A little.,5,8
SAM, Me too.,5,8
SAM, Who’s there?,5,8
OLLY, Olly.,5,8
SAM, Come in.,5,8
OLLY, I heard what happened.,5,8
SAM, Not to worry. Men brawl from time to time. It’s only natural.,5,8
OLLY, Figured you were hungry.,5,8
SAM, You’re a good lad.,5,8
OLLY, Wanted to ask you something. (Olly looks at Gilly) If you’ve got the time.,5,8
GILLY, I need to check on baby Sam.,5,8
SAM, Now then. How can I help?,5,8
OLLY, It’s about the Lord Commander.,5,8
SAM, Yes?,5,8
OLLY, He’s going up to Hardhome to save all them wildlings. Wildlings killed my mom and dad. They killed everyone in my village.,5,8
SAM, We’ve been fighting them for years.,5,8
OLLY, This wasn’t a fight. We were farmers and they slaughtered us. So why’s he saving them?,5,8
SAM," Wildlings are people, just like us. There are good ones and bad ones.",5,8
OLLY," The one he’s travelling with, the one with the red beard, he led the raid on my village.",5,8
SAM, Olly...,5,8
OLLY, How can he trust him?,5,8
SAM," I’ve seen the army of the dead. I’ve seen the white walkers, and they’re coming for us, for all the living. And when it’s time we’ll need every last man we can find.",5,8
OLLY, But what if we let the wildings through the gates and they cut our throats while we sleep?,5,8
SAM," Jon’s taking a risk, but he has to. We don’t stand a chance otherwise. Sometimes a man has to make hard choices, choices that might look wrong to others but you know are right in the long run.",5,8
OLLY, You believe that?,5,8
SAM, With all my heart.,5,8
SAM, Try not to worry Olly. I’ve been worrying about Jon for years. He always comes back.,5,8
TORMUND, You trust me Jon Snow?,5,8
JON, Does that make me a fool?,5,8
TORMUND, We are fools together now.,5,8
TORMUND, Lord of Bones. Been a long time.,5,8
LORD OF BONES, Last time I saw you the little crow was your prisoner. The other way around now. What happened?,5,8
TORMUND, War.,5,8
LORD OF BONES, You call that a war? The greatest army the North has ever seen cut to pieces by a southern king.,5,8
TORMUND, We should gather the elders find somewhere quiet to talk.,5,8
LORD OF BONES, You don’t give the orders here.,5,8
TORMUND, I’m not giving an order.,5,8
LORD OF BONES, Why aren’t you in chains?,5,8
JON, He’s not my prisoner.,5,8
LORD OF BONES, What is he?,5,8
JON, We’re allies.,5,8
LORD OF BONES, You fucking traitor! You fight for the crows now.,5,8
TORMUND, I don’t fight for the crows.,5,8
JON, We’re not here to fight. We’re here to talk.,5,8
LORD OF BONES," Is that right? You and the pretty crow do a lot of talking, Tormund. And when you’re done talking, do you get down on your knees and suck his cock--",5,8
TORMUND, Gather the elders and let’s talk.,5,8
JON, My name’s Jon Snow. I’m Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch. We’re not friends. We’ve never been friends. We won’t become friends today. This isn’t about friendship. This is about survival. This is about putting a 700 foot wall between you and what’s out there.,5,8
KARSI, You built that wall to keep us out.,5,8
LOBODA, Since when do the crows give 2 shits if we live?,5,8
JON, In normal times we wouldn’t. But these aren’t normal times. The white walkers don’t care if a man’s Free Folk or Crow. We’re all the same to them. Meat to their army. But together we can beat them.,5,8
KARSI," Beat the white walkers? Good luck with that. Run from them, maybe.",5,8
JON, It’s not a trick. It’s a gift for those who join us.,5,8
JON, Dragonglass. A man of the Night’s Watch used one of these daggers to kill a walker.,5,8
LOBODA, You saw this?,5,8
JON, No. But I trust the man.,5,8
KARSI, There are old stories about Dragonglass.,5,8
LOBODA, There are old stories about ice spiders big as hounds.,5,8
KARSI, And with the things we’ve seen you don’t believe them?,5,8
JON, Come with me and I'll share these weapons.,5,8
KARSI, Come with you where?,5,8
JON, There are good lands south of the wall. The Night's Watch will allow you through the tunnel and allow your people to farm those lands.,5,8
JON," I knew Mance Rayder. He never wanted a war with the Night’s Watch, he wanted a new life for his people. For you. We’re prepared to give you that new life.",5,8
KARSI, If…?,5,8
JON, If you swear you join us when the real war begins.,5,8
LOBODA, Where is Mance?,5,8
JON, He died.,5,8
LOBODA, How?,5,8
JON (after a long pause), I put an arrow through his heart.,5,8
LOBODA, I say we send the Lord Commander back to Castle Black with no eyes.,5,8
TORMUND," None of you saw Mance die! I did. The Southern King who broke our army, Stannis, wanted to burn him alive to send him a message. Jon Snow defied that cunt’s orders. His arrow was mercy. What it did took courage, and that’s what we need today: the courage to make peace with men we’ve been fighting for generations.",5,8
TORMUND," None of you saw Mance die! I did. The Southern King who broke our army, Stannis, wanted to burn him alive to send him a message. Jon Snow defied that cunt’s orders. His arrow was mercy. What it did took courage, and that’s what we need today: the courage to make peace with men we’ve been fighting for generations.",5,8
KARSI," I lost my father, my uncle, and 2 brothers fighting the damn crows.",5,8
JON," I’m not asking you to forget your dead. I’ll never forget mine. I lost 50 brothers the night that Mance attacked the wall. But I’m asking you to think about your children now. They’ll never have children of their own if we don’t band together. The Long Night is coming and the dead come with it. No clan can stop them. The free folk can’t stop them. The Night’s Watch can’t stop them. And all the southern kings can’t stop them. Only together, all of us, and even then it might not be enough, but at least then we’ll give the fuckers a fight.",5,8
KARSI," You vouch for this man, Tormund?",5,8
TORMUND," He’s prettier than both my daughters, but he knows how to fight. He’s young, but he knows how to lead. He didn’t have to come to Hardhome. He came because he needs us. And we need him.",5,8
LOBODA, My ancestors would spit on me if I broke bread with a crow.,5,8
KARSI," So would mine, but fuck 'em, they’re dead.",5,8
TORMUND, This is the way.,5,8
WILDLING ELDER, I’m with Tormund. We stay here we’re dead men. At least with King Crow there’s a chance.,5,8
GIANT, Tormund.,5,8
LOBODA," Keep that new life you want to give us. Keep your glass, King Crow. Soon as you get on his ships they’re gonna slit your throats and dump your bodies to the bottom of the Shivering Sea. That’s our enemy. That has always been our enemy.",5,8
KARSI (to Tormund), I fucking hate Thenns.,5,8
JON, How many are with us? 5000?,5,8
TORMUND, I’m not good at counting.,5,8
JON, We’re leaving too many behind.,5,8
TORMUND, The free folk are stubborn. You know how long it took Mance to band them together. 20 fucking years.,5,8
JON, And he knew them better than I ever will.,5,8
TORMUND, They’re running out of food and there’s nothing to hunt. They’ll come around.,5,8
KARSI," Johnna is gonna look after you. She’s in charge, you listen to her.",5,8
DAUGHTER, I wanna go with you.,5,8
KARSI," I need to get the old folks on the boats. I’m right behind you, I promise. (she kisses them on the forehead) Go on.",5,8
WUN WUN, Lokh kif rukh?,5,8
LOBODA, Shut the gate.,5,8
LOBODA, Shut the gate!!,5,8
SHOUTING, Wait! Open the gate! Let us in! Help us! Please open it!,5,8
LOBODA, Ready your arrows!,5,8
JON, Get in line! Get in line!,5,8
JON, Hold the line! Hold the line!,5,8
NIGHT’S WATCH BROTHER, Lord Commander!,5,8
JON, Get them to the ship and come back for me!,5,8
BROTHER, But you’ll never make it--,5,8
JON, Now!,5,8
JON, You should be on one of those boats.,5,8
KARSI, So should you ! My little girl has gone on. They're gonna let them pass the wall even if you’re not there ?,5,8
JON, You have my word. I’ve given orders.,5,8
KARSI, Don’t think you’re gonna be there to enforce those orders !,5,8
TORMUND," If they get through, everyone dies !",5,8
JON, Night’s Watch with me! Move! Move! Move!,5,8
JON, The Dragonglass!,5,8
LOBODA," You’re with me, lad! Now!",5,8
LOBODA, Get the glass.,5,8
JON, The Dragonglass!,5,8
EDD, Fuck the glass! We’re gonna die here.,5,8
JON, Go! Go! Go!,5,8
TORMUND," Wun Wun, to the sea.",5,8
JON, Let’s go now! Now!,5,8
DAVOS," A band of 20 men, maybe less. They were in and out before anyone spotted them, burnt our food stores to the ground, all our siege weapons were destroyed, dozens of tents were--",5,9
STANNIS, Horses?,5,9
DAVOS," We’re still getting a count, but hundreds are dead.",5,9
STANNIS, 20 men rode into our camp without a single guard sounding the alarm?,5,9
DAVOS, The northerners know more about their land than we ever will.,5,9
STANNIS," Put last night’s guards in chains, either they fell asleep or they were conspiring with the enemy. Find out the truth and then hang them.",5,9
DAVOS," Unless there’s a thaw, we can’t press forward to Winterfell, and we don’t have enough food to get us back to Castle Black.",5,9
STANNIS, We’re not returning to Castle Black.,5,9
DAVOS," Forgive me, Your Grace, I never claimed to be an expert in military matters. But if we can’t march forward, and we won’t march back…",5,9
STANNIS, Have the dead horses butchered for meat.,5,9
ALLISER, Open the gates.,5,9
JON, It was a failure.,5,9
SAM, It wasn’t.,5,9
JON," I went to save them, I failed.",5,9
SAM," You didn’t fail him, or him, or her. Every one of them is alive because of you, and no one else.",5,9
JON, I don’t think that fact’s lost on them.,5,9
ALLISER," You have a good heart, Jon Snow. It will get us all killed.",5,9
DAVOS," You sent for me, Your Grace.",5,9
STANNIS," Find you some healthy horses and a few good men to guard you, I’m sending you back to Castle Black. Tell the Lord Commander to send food, supplies, fresh horses, in return when I take the throne I’ll make sure the Night’s Watch has all the men it requires. He can guard all 19 castles if he so wishes.",5,9
DAVOS," Your Grace, you’ve named me your Hand.",5,9
STANNIS, Yes.,5,9
DAVOS," The King’s Hand should never abandon the King, especially in a time of war.",5,9
STANNIS," You’re not abandoning me, you’re obeying a command.",5,9
DAVOS, A boy with a scroll could deliver this message.,5,9
STANNIS," And if Jon Snow refuses a boy with a scroll, what does the boy say? I didn’t name you hand for your expertise in military matters, ride for Castle Black, don’t come back empty handed.",5,9
DAVOS," Your Grace, perhaps Queen and Princess Shireen could accompany me.",5,9
STANNIS, My family stays with me.,5,9
DAVOS, At least let me take Shireen. A siege is no place for a little girl.,5,9
STANNIS, My family stays with me.,5,9
DAVOS, What’s this one now?,5,9
SHIREEN," ""The Dance of Dragons: A True Telling"" by Grand Maester Munkun.",5,9
SHIREEN," ""The Dance of Dragons: A True Telling"" by Grand Maester Munkun.",5,9
DAVOS, Well that sounds like a proper story.,5,9
SHIREEN," Ser Byron Swann wanted to kill the dragon Vhagar. He polished his shield for a week, til the steel was like a mirror. Then he crouched behind it, and crept forward, hoping the dragon would only see his own reflection.",5,9
DAVOS," But the dragon only saw a dumb man, holding a mirrored shield.",5,9
SHIREEN, And burnt him to a crisp.,5,9
DAVOS," Thus ending the dragonslaying career of Ser Byron Swann. I made you something, Princess.",5,9
DAVOS, Do you like it?,5,9
SHIREEN, He’s beautiful.,5,9
SHIREEN, Thank you.,5,9
DAVOS, You’re very welcome.,5,9
SHIREEN," Will you make me a doe, too, so that he can have company?",5,9
DAVOS, Of course I will.,5,9
SHIREEN, But why am I getting a present?,5,9
DAVOS," Because you deserve it. My son was always on me trying to teach me to read. Gods, I was stubborn about it. Made it this far without reading, seemed to me I could make it to the grave. I wish I had listened to them. This is my own poor way of saying thank you for teaching me to be a grown up. (beat) I’ll be gone for a few days, Princess. I’ll want to hear all about the dance of dragons when I’m back.",5,9
SHIREEN, You’ll just have to read it yourself.,5,9
JAIME, Prince Doran. (bows),5,9
DORAN," Forgive us, we started without you. Please, sit.",5,9
JAIME, Princess Myrcella.,5,9
MYRCELLA, Uncle.,5,9
JAIME, What a lovely dress.,5,9
MYRCELLA, You don’t like it?,5,9
JAIME, You must be cold.,5,9
MYRCELLA, Not at all. The Dornish climate agrees with me.,5,9
JAIME, Prince Trystane. How’s your jaw?,5,9
TRYSTANE, A fleabite.,5,9
ELLARIA, What are you doing in Dorne?,5,9
JAIME," Looking out for the safety of my niece, the princess Myrcella.",5,9
DORAN, And rather than send a raven or speak to me directly you decided to enter my country in secret and abduct our guest by force.,5,9
JAIME, We received a threatening message. The princess’s necklace in the jaws of a viper.,5,9
MYRCELLA (surprised), That necklace was stolen from my room.,5,9
JAIME, Ah. Excellent. The last meal before the beheading.,5,9
DORAN, We can’t behead you. Many in Dorne want war. But I’ve seen war. I’ve seen the bodies piled on the battlefields. I’ve seen the orphans starving in the cities. I don’t want to lead my people into that hell.,5,9
ELLARIA," No, you want to break bread with the Lannisters.",5,9
DORAN," And that is precisely what we are doing. (raises glass) Let us drink to Tommen, the first of his name, the King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.",5,9
DORAN, King Tommen insists on his sister’s return to the capital?,5,9
JAIME, I’m afraid he does.,5,9
DORAN," I cannot disobey my King’s command. (Ellaria glares at Doran) She will return with you to King’s Landing. And my son, Prince Trystane, will accompany you both. If the alliance between Dorne and the Iron Throne is to continue, their engagement must stand.",5,9
JAIME, I accept.,5,9
DORAN," One more thing. My brother was named to the small council before his death. Your father understood the importance of keeping Dorne in the loop. With Oberyn gone, Trystane will take his place on the small council.",5,9
JAIME, You have my word.,5,9
ELLARIA, The word of a Kingslayer.,5,9
ELLARIA, No wonder you can’t stand. You have no spine.,5,9
DORAN," You are mother to four of my nieces, girls I love very much. For their sake, I hope you live a long life. Talk to me that way again and you won’t.",5,9
JAIME, May I inquire into the fate of my man?,5,9
DORAN," Tell me, Ser Jaime, in King’s Landing, how do they punish a commoner who strikes a prince?",5,9
JAIME, He said it was just a fleabite. The fault is mine. Bronn is merely a soldier following my orders. If anyone should be punished it’s me.,5,9
DORAN, Prince Trystane must learn judgement if he’s to rule one day. I’ll let him decide.,5,9
TRYSTANE, I have learned the value of mercy from my father. I will set your man free.,5,9
JAIME, You’re a good man.,5,9
TRYSTANE, On one condition.,5,9
NYMERIA," Why do we play? I’m better than you, I’ll always be better than you. Have I ever missed once? I don’t think, I can’t recall. You must love humiliation or pain. Which do you love most? Humiliation or-- (slaps) -- pain? That one hurt didn’t it? You going to cry? Give up, little sister.",5,9
TYENE, You’re going to miss.,5,9
NYMERIA, I never miss.,5,9
TYENE, You will. You’re thinking too much. Now you’re nervous. “What if she’s right?”,5,9
NYMERIA, Luck.,5,9
TYENE, Now it’s my turn.,5,9
NYMERIA, You’re too slow. You’ve always been too slow.,5,9
BRONN, Am I going to be happy at the end of this walk?,5,9
AREO, You’ll find out very soon.,5,9
TYENE," Say it one more time, handsome. Who am I?",5,9
BRONN, The most beautiful woman in the world.,5,9
TYENE, And that’s the truth!,5,9
NYMERIA, Slut.,5,9
JAIME," Prince Doran, Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.",5,9
DORAN, : I didn’t realize there were knights of the Blackwater.,5,9
DORAN, : I didn’t realize there were knights of the Blackwater.,5,9
BRONN, Only the one.,5,9
JAIME, I believe you’ve already met Prince Trystane.,5,9
BRONN, Prince. Sorry about the other day.,5,9
JAIME, Prince Trystane here is a man of mercy. He’s agreed to grant you your freedom.,5,9
BRONN, I’m glad to hear it. The pie looks good.,5,9
JAIME, There was one condition.,5,9
DORAN, Perhaps some soup instead?,5,9
ARYA," Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cock--",5,9
MAN, How much for your little clam?,5,9
ARYA," Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels!",5,9
THIN MAN (waving), Come on.,5,9
THIN MAN," Some oysters, girl! I’m talking to you! Girl?! Are you deaf? Girl?!",5,9
BANKER," Lord Tyrell! On behalf of the Iron Bank, may I be the first to welcome you to the free city of Braavos. I hope your journey was trouble free.",5,9
MACE, Bit of chop the last few days but nothing too awful. Good to see the old chap is still guarding the Harbor.,5,9
BANKER, And how goes the harvest in the Reach?,5,9
MACE," Vintnors say this might be the best year for red grapes in half a century. If we come to a satisfactory arrangement, I’ll be sure to send the Arbor’s finest your way.",5,9
BANKER, I’m afraid I don’t partake.,5,9
MACE," Some consider usury distasteful, dishonorable. Pure nonsense, of course.",5,9
BANKER, I'm glad we see eye-to-eye on this matter.,5,9
MACE, Did you know that at one point Maegor the third tried to outlaw it in the Seven Kingdoms? Wanted to arrest anyone caught charging interest and cut off both their hands.,5,9
BANKER, Most unfortunate for the glovers.,5,9
MACE," If a man charges low interest on a loan then he has nothing to gain and everything to lose, so why charge him? Whereas a reward makes a man willing to gamble.",5,9
BANKER," We are not gamblers here at the Iron Bank, Lord Tyrell.",5,9
MACE, You are the world's best gamblers. And all those bets you won built this.,5,9
BANKER, I’m afraid I still have a good deal of work to do.,5,9
MACE," Oh, nonsense. Work's over. Do you sing?",5,9
BANKER, I don't have that gift.,5,9
MACE," It's not a gift, it’s a skill, anyone can learn it. “So give me a kiss by the Long Canall and give me two kisses in Salty Town, for we are going to die, tomorrow. The bareheaded beggar, the king with his crown…”",5,9
MERYN, I thought that old shit would never stop singing.,5,9
MAN," It wasn’t bad, though.",5,9
MERYN," The Tyrells can all rot in hell, treasonous cunts. They were going to make that boy-fucker Renly king.",5,9
MERYN," This is the place, lads. The sleekest little minks in Braavos.",5,9
MAN, You’re buying?,5,9
MERYN," Oh, I’m buying. But I never was good at sharing.",5,9
BROTHEL KEEPER, Sell your fish somewhere else.,5,9
PROSTITUTE," Oh let her in, Brusco, I’m hungry. Come here, sweetness.",5,9
PROSTITUTE, They say oyster’s get the juices flowing. We’ll take half a dozen.,5,9
ARYA, Three coppers.,5,9
JOHN, Here’s a silver because the lady likes you.,5,9
MERYN, Too old.,5,9
HEAD PROSTITUTE, Brea.,5,9
MERYN, Too old.,5,9
HEAD," I have just the one. Anara our most expensive girl, but well worth it, I assure you.",5,9
MERYN, Too old.,5,9
MERYN, Do you have what I want or not?,5,9
HEAD, Of course. Of course.,5,9
MAN," Fresh? Come on, the lads are hungry.",5,9
MAN, Nothing better for you cock stand than fresh oysters.,5,9
MAN 2, I’ll have one.,5,9
HEAD, Who let this girl in? Shoo shoo!,5,9
MERYN, Good.,5,9
MERYN, I’ll tell you when we’re done.,5,9
MERYN, You’ll have a fresh one for me tomorrow.,5,9
HEAD, Of course.,5,9
HEAD," I’ll have you whipped, girl! Go on!",5,9
MAN, Valaar morghulis.,5,9
JAQEN, And?,5,9
ARYA, The Thin Man wasn’t hungry today.,5,9
JAQEN, Perhaps that’s why the man is thin.,5,9
ARYA, Tomorrow.,5,9
JAQEN, Tomorrow.,5,9
JAQEN, A girl has work to do.,5,9
DORAN," Your rebellion is over. You can swear your allegiance to me now, or you can die.",5,9
DORAN, I believe in second chances. I don’t believe in third chances.,5,9
ELLARIA, You write like a 7 year old.,5,9
JAIME, Your maester kindly agreed to copy it over for me.,5,9
ELLARIA, He didn’t try to make you pay?,5,9
ELLARIA, Then maybe he’s changed. The Queen will be thrilled to know you’ll be bringing her daughter home,5,9
JAIME, She will.,5,9
ELLARIA," You love her very much, don’t you?",5,9
JAIME," Of course, she’s my niece.",5,9
ELLARIA, I wasn’t talking about her.,5,9
ELLARIA," You think I disapprove. Why? Because people disapprove of that sort of thing where you are from? They disapproved of Oberyn and me where you are from. Here, no one blinked an eye. 100 years ago, no one would have blinked an eye at you if you had been named Targaryen. It’s always changing, who we’re supposed to love and who we’re not.The only thing that stays the same is that we want who we want.",5,9
ELLARIA, I know your daughter had no part in the terrible thing that happened to the man I loved. Perhaps even you were innocent of that.,5,9
SHIREEN, Father. Aren’t you cold?,5,9
STANNIS, No. What are you reading?,5,9
SHIREEN, The Dance of Dragons.,5,9
STANNIS, What’s it about?,5,9
SHIREEN," It’s the story of the fight between Rhaenyra Targaryen and her half-brother Aegon for control of the Seven Kingdoms. Both of them thought they belonged on the Iron Throne. When people started for declaring for one of them or the other, their fight divided the kingdom in two. Brothers fought brothers. Dragons fought dragons. By the time it was over, thousands were dead. And it was a disaster for the Targaryens as well. They never truly recovered.",5,9
STANNIS, “The dance of dragons”? Why is that a dance?,5,9
SHIREEN, That’s just what they call it.,5,9
STANNIS, Doesn’t make much sense.,5,9
SHIREEN, I think it’s poetic.,5,9
STANNIS," If you had to choose between Rhaenyra and Aegon, who would you have chosen?",5,9
SHIREEN, I wouldn’t have chosen either. It’s all the choosing sides that made things so horrible.,5,9
STANNIS," Sometimes a person has to choose. Sometimes the world forces his hand. If a man knows what he is and remains true to himself, the choice is not choice at all. He must fulfill his destiny and become who he is meant to be. However much he may hate it.",5,9
SHIREEN," It’s alright, father.",5,9
STANNIS, You don’t even know what I’m talking about.,5,9
SHIREEN, It doesn’t matter. I want to help you. Is there any way I can help?,5,9
STANNIS, Yes there is.,5,9
SHIREEN," Good, I want to. I’m the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon and I’m your daughter.",5,9
STANNIS, Forgive me.,5,9
SHIREEN, Where’s my father? I want to see my father.,5,9
MELISANDRE," It will all be over soon, Princess.",5,9
SHIREEN," Where’s my father? No you can’t do this, father where are you?!",5,9
SHIREEN," Let me see my father! Where are you, please?!",5,9
SELYSE, It’s what the Lord wants. It’s a good thing. A great thing.,5,9
MELISANDRE," The year is now, my Lord. For you we offer up this girl, that you may cleanse her with your fire and that its light may lead our way.",5,9
SELYSE," If we don’t act then we’ll all starve here all of us, but if we make this sacrifice…",5,9
MELISANDRE," Accept this token of our faith, my lord and lead us from the darkness. Lord of Light show us the way!",5,9
SHIREEN," Mother, please mother! Mother, please mother!",5,9
SELYSE, I can’t.,5,9
STANNIS, There’s no other way. She has King’s blood.,5,9
MELISANDRE," Lord of Light protect us, for the night is dark and full of terrors!",5,9
SHIREEN," Mother, don’t do this please! Please help! Don’t do this! Please, father! Mother, help!",5,9
SELYSE, No...,5,9
DAENERYS, Where have you been?,5,9
HIZDAHR, Just making sure everything’s in order.,5,9
ANNOUNCER (Valyrian)," Free citizens of Meereen! By the blessings of the Graces and her majesty the Queen, welcome to the Great Games!",5,9
ANNOUNCER," My queen, our first contest. Who will triumph: the strong or the quick?",5,9
ANNOUNCER," My queen, our first contest. Who will triumph: the strong or the quick?",5,9
QUICK," I fight and die for your glory, oh glorious queen.",5,9
STRONG," I fight and die for your glory, oh glorious queen.",5,9
HIZDAHR, They’re waiting for you. Clap your hands.,5,9
DAARIO," That one, the smaller man, no question, that’s where you should put your money.",5,9
TYRION, The smaller man it is.,5,9
DAENERYS, I’m not putting my money anywhere.,5,9
HIZDAHR, Kings and queens never bet on the games. Perhaps you should go find someone who does.,5,9
DAARIO, People used to bet against me when I fought in the pits. (looks at Hizdahr) He would have bet against me. Common novice mistake.,5,9
HIZDAHR," I have spent much of my life in Meereen, and in my experience, larger men do triumph over smaller man, far more often than not.",5,9
DAENERYS," Has your experience ever involved any actual fighting? You, yourself, have you ever tried to kill a man that was trying to kill you?",5,9
DAARIO," Whenever I got into the pit against a beast like that one, the crowd saw me, all skin and bone back then, then they saw a pile of angry muscles ready to murder me. They couldn’t get their money out fast enough. But the pile of angry muscles never had any muscles here (he puts a dagger to his neck) or here (he puts the dagger to Hizdahr’s neck). And the big men were always too slow to stop my dagger from going where their muscles weren’t. Yes, whenever I saw a beast like that one, standing across from me making his beast faces, I knew I could rest easy.",5,9
HIZDAHR, You don’t approve?,5,9
TYRION, There’s always been more than enough death in the world for my taste. I can do without it in my leisure time.,5,9
HIZDAHR," Fair enough, yet -- it’s an unpleasant question -- but what great thing has ever been accomplished without killing or cruelty?",5,9
TYRION, It’s easy to confuse what is with what ought to be. Especially when what is has worked in your favor.,5,9
HIZDAHR, I’m not talking about myself. I’m talking about the necessary conditions of greatness.,5,9
DAENERYS, That is greatness?,5,9
HIZDAHR, That is a vital part of the great city of Meereen. Which has existed long before you arrived and will remain standing long after we have returned to the dirt.,5,9
TYRION, My father would have liked you.,5,9
ANNOUNCER, We ask again: who will triumph?,5,9
ANNOUNCER, We ask again: who will triumph?,5,9
DAENERYS, One day your great city will return to the dirt as well.,5,9
HIZDAHR, At your command?,5,9
DAENERYS, If need be.,5,9
ANNOUNCER, A Meereenese champion?,5,9
HIZDAHR, How many people will die to make this happen?,5,9
DAENERYS, If it comes to that they would have died for a good reason.,5,9
HIZDAHR (looks at pit), Those men think they’re dying for a good reason.,5,9
DAENERYS, Someone else’s reason.,5,9
HIZDAHR," So your reasons are true, and theirs are false. They don’t know their own minds, but you do.",5,9
TYRION," Well said, you’re an eloquent man. Doesn’t mean you’re wrong. In my experience, eloquent men are right every bit as often as imbeciles.",5,9
ANNOUNCER, ...or a Westerosi Knight?!,5,9
JORAH (O.S.)," I fight and die for your glory, oh glorious Queen.",5,9
HIZDAHR, Your Grace--,5,9
DAARIO, Shut your mouth.,5,9
TYRION, You can end this.,5,9
HIZDAHR, She cannot.,5,9
TYRION, You can!,5,9
DAARIO, Protect your queen!,5,9
HIZDAHR," Your Grace, Your Grace, come with me! I know a way out! I know a way--",5,9
TYRION, Stay close!,5,9
JORAH, This way!,5,9
DAARIO," The other side, follow me!",5,9
DAARIO, Protect your queen!,5,9
DAENERYS, Drogon!,5,9
DAENERYS, Valahd..,5,9
MELISANDRE," The Lord of Light has made good on his promise, my king. His fires have melted the snows away. The way ahead is clear.",5,10
STANNIS, We ride for Winterfell.,5,10
MELISANDRE, And you will take it. The Lord has shown me Bolton banners burning. You will receive what is yours by right.,5,10
SOLDIER, Your Grace.,5,10
STANNIS, Prepare to form up.,5,10
SOLDIER, Your Grace.,5,10
STANNIS, Tell me.,5,10
SOLDIER, The men. Many deserted before dawn.,5,10
STANNIS, How many?,5,10
SOLDIER," Nearly half. All the sell-swords, with all the horses.",5,10
SOLDIER 2, Your Grace?,5,10
STANNIS, Speak up. It can’t be worse than mutiny.,5,10
STANNIS, Cut her down.,5,10
SOLDIER, Your Grace. The Lady Melisandre was just seen riding out of camp.,5,10
STANNIS, Get the men into marching formation. On to Winterfell.,5,10
JON," He raised his hands. And they all stood up at once. Tens of thousands of them, the biggest army in the world.",5,10
SAM, So what are you gonna do?,5,10
JON, I’m gonna hope they don’t learn how to climb the wall.,5,10
SAM, But… the Dragonglass?,5,10
JON (shakes his head)," No one’s ever getting that back, now. It wouldn’t have mattered anyway, unless we had a mountain of it.",5,10
SAM (confused), But… you killed a White Walker.,5,10
JON, With Longclaw. I saw them shatter steel axes like they were glass. But Longclaw…,5,10
SAM, He’s made of Valyrian steel. How many Valyrian steel swords are left in the Seven Kingdoms?,5,10
JON, Not enough. (pause) The first Lord Commander in history to sacrifice the lives of sworn Brothers to save the lives of Wildlings. How’s it feel to be friends with the most hated man in Castle Black? (smiles),5,10
SAM, You were friends with me when I first got here. And I wasn’t winning any elections back then.,5,10
JON, Here’s to us then. Long may they sneer.,5,10
JON, What?,5,10
SAM," I wanted to ask you something. To ask something of you. Send me, Gilly, and the baby to Oldtown so I can become a Maester. That’s what I’m meant to be, not this.",5,10
JON," I need you here, Sam. If you leave, who’s left to give me advice I trust?",5,10
SAM," Well, there’s Edd.",5,10
SAM," I’ll be more use to you as a Maester. More use to everyone now that Maester Aemon’s gone. The Citadel has the world’s greatest library. I’ll learn about history, strategy, healing. And other things. Things that will help when they come.",5,10
SAM," If Gilly stays here then she’ll die. And the baby that she named after me will die. And I’ll end up dying, too, trying to protect them. Which means that the last thing that I’ll see in this world will be the look in her eyes when I fail them. (pause) I’d rather see a thousand White Walkers than see that.",5,10
SAM, Thank you.,5,10
JON," You know that The Citadel will make you swear off women, too.",5,10
SAM, They’ll bloody try.,5,10
JON, Sam?,5,10
SAM, What?,5,10
JON, Sam…,5,10
JON, You’ve just been beaten half to death. How did you--,5,10
SAM (smiling), Very carefully.,5,10
JON, I’m glad the end of the world’s working out for someone.,5,10
SAM, I’ll come back.,5,10
JON (raises a glass), To your return.,5,10
SAM, To my return.,5,10
PODRICK, My lady! Stannis. Stannis Baratheon is coming. His whole army.,5,10
BRIENNE, How do you know it’s Stannis?,5,10
PODRICK, He’s carrying his flaming heart banners. From the Blackwater. I’ll never forget it.,5,10
STANNIS, Trench here. Another one 300 yards from the castle wall. Hurry them along. And send out a foraging party immediately. The siege begins at sunrise.,5,10
SOLDIER," There’s not going to be a siege, Your Grace.",5,10
STANNIS, Bolton has women fighting for him.,5,10
BRIENNE, I do not fight for the Boltons. I’m Brienne of Tarth. I was Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon. I was there when he was murdered by a shadow with your face. You murdered him? With blood magic?,5,10
STANNIS, I did.,5,10
BRIENNE," In the name of Renly of House Baratheon, First of his Name, Rightful King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, and Protector of the Realm, I, Brienne of Tarth, sentence you to die. Do you have any last words?",5,10
STANNIS," Go on, do your duty.",5,10
CUT TO, EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD,5,10
RAMSAY, Looks like we’re done here.,5,10
SURVIVOR, I surrender. I surrender!,5,10
RAMSAY, And I accept your surrender.,5,10
RAMSAY (to squire), Let’s head back. My wife must be lonely.,5,10
MYRANDA, My lady. I have come to escort you back to your chamber.,5,10
THEON, Go with her. Please.,5,10
SANSA," I know what Ramsay is. I know what he’ll do to me. (looks to Theon) If I’m going to die, let it happen while there’s some of me left.",5,10
MYRANDA," Die? (lowers the bow) Who said anything about dying? You can’t die yet. Your father was Warden of the North, and Ramsay needs you. Though I suppose he doesn’t need all of you. Just the parts he’ll use to make his heir. Until you’ve given him a boy or two and he’s finished using them. (raises bow) He’s got incredible plans for those parts. So. Shall we wait for him to come back, or shall we begin now?",5,10
MYRANDA, You’re leaving it to me? Good. Let’s begin.,5,10
MYRANDA, Stop! Stop!,5,10
MAN, Open the gates!,5,10
THEON, He’s coming back.,5,10
MERYN, I can see I have my work cut out for me.You two. Out.,5,10
ARYA," You were the first person on my list, you know. For killing Syrio Forel, remember him? Probably not. I’ve gotten a few of the others. The Many Faced God stole a few more for me. I’m glad he left me you. Do you know who I am?",5,10
ARYA, I can’t hear you.,5,10
ARYA, You know who I am. I’m Arya Stark.,5,10
ARYA, Do you know who you are?,5,10
ARYA, You’re no one. You’re nothing.,5,10
JAQEN, A girl has taken a life. The wrong life.,5,10
WAIF, I was right about her.,5,10
JAQEN, You were.,5,10
WAIF, You’re not ready. Not at all.,5,10
JAQEN, That man’s life wasn’t yours to take. A girl stole from the Many Faced God. Now a debt is owed.,5,10
JAQEN, Only death can pay for life.,5,10
ARYA," No! No! No, you don’t die! Don’t die! (sobs)",5,10
WAIF, Why are you crying?,5,10
ARYA, He was my friend.,5,10
WAIF, No he wasn’t. Didn’t you listen to him?,5,10
JAQEN (O.S.), He was no one.,5,10
ARYA, But if you’re… (looks to the Jaqen who drank the potion and is seemingly dead) Who’s this?,5,10
JAQEN, No one at all. Just as a girl should have been before she took a face from the hall.,5,10
JAQEN, The faces are for no one.,5,10
JAQEN, You are still someone.,5,10
JAQEN, And to someone…,5,10
JAQEN, ...the faces are as good as poison.,5,10
ARYA, I can’t see!,5,10
ARYA, What’s happening?! What’s happening?!,5,10
DORAN (to Jaime), I wish you a safe journey home.,5,10
JAIME, Thank you.,5,10
ELLARIA, Forgive me child. I wish you all the happiness in the world.,5,10
BRONN, Maybe I’ll come visit you sometime.,5,10
TYENE, Maybe I’ll come visit you.,5,10
BRONN, Don’t wait too long. I’ve a noble woman to marry back home.,5,10
TYENE (leans in)," You want a good girl, but you need the bad pussy. (bites his ear)",5,10
JAIME (to Bronn)," Whenever you’re ready, My Lord.",5,10
JAIME, Try not to lose it this time.,5,10
MYRCELLA, I’ll never take it off again.,5,10
JAIME, I know you didn’t want to leave Dorne. But I’m glad you’re coming home. Your mother’s desperate to see you. And I’m glad Trystane’s coming with us. He seems like a nice boy. You’re lucky. Arranged marriages are rarely so… so well arranged.,5,10
MYRCELLA, Do you think mother will like him.,5,10
JAIME," If she sees you’re happy, I’m sure she will.",5,10
MYRCELLA (laughing), And you really believe that?,5,10
JAIME (smiles), Have you ever known your mother to like anyone aside from her children?,5,10
MYRCELLA, She likes you.,5,10
JAIME," I’m not so sure about that. Listen. There’s something I’ve wanted to tell you. Something I should have told you long ago. So. Now that you’ve seen more of the world, you’ve learned how complicated things can be. People can be. The Lannisters and the Martells have hated each other for years, but you’ve fallen in love with Trystane. It was an accident, really, I mean what were the chances? You happen to fall in love with the man you were assigned to marry? (Myrcella laughs) My point is… we don’t choose whom we love. We just… It’s beyond our control. I sound like an idiot.",5,10
MYRCELLA, No you don’t.,5,10
JAIME, What I’m trying to say. What I’m trying and failing to say…,5,10
MYRCELLA, I know what you’re trying to say.,5,10
JAIME, No. I’m afraid you don’t.,5,10
MYRCELLA, I do.,5,10
MYRCELLA, I know. About you and mother. I think a part of me always knew. And I’m glad. I’m glad that you’re my father.,5,10
JAIME, Myrcella?,5,10
JAIME, Myrcella?!,5,10
JAIME, Myrcella?! Myrcella?!,5,10
CUT TO, EXT. DORNE - DOCK,5,10
TYRION (to Jorah)," You love her, don’t you? How could you not. Of course, it’s hopeless for the both of you. Sellsword from the fighting pits, a disgraced knight. Neither one of you is fit consort for a queen. But, we always want the wrong woman.",5,10
DAARIO, Does he always talk so much?,5,10
GREY WORM, Jorah the Andal.,5,10
JORAH, Torgo Nudho.,5,10
GREY WORM, You should not be here.,5,10
DAARIO," No, but he is.",5,10
GREY WORM, Our queen ordered him exiled from city.,5,10
DAARIO, Our queen would be dead if not for him.,5,10
MISSANDEI (Valyrian), It’s true. And I would be dead if not for the… (look at Tyrion) little man.,5,10
TYRION (Valyrian), Dwarf. I believe that’s the word. Apologies. My Valyrian is a bit “nostril”.,5,10
MISSANDEI, (Valyrian) A bit “rusty”.,5,10
TYRION, (Valyrian) “Rusty” (Common Tongue) Thank you.,5,10
GREY WORM, I am sorry. Sorry I am not there to fight for my queen.,5,10
DAARIO, You missed a good scrap.,5,10
JORAH, None of that matters now. The longer we sit here bantering the longer Daenerys is out there in the wilderness.,5,10
TYRION," He’s right. The dragon headed north. If we’re going to find her, that’s where we’re to go.",5,10
JORAH, We? You’re a Lannister. The Queen intends to remove your family from power.,5,10
TYRION, And I intend to help her do it.,5,10
JORAH, You’ve been here for how many days now? I’ve fought for her for years. Since she was little more than a child.,5,10
TYRION, You betrayed her!,5,10
JORAH, Careful now.,5,10
TYRION," And she exiled you, twice, I believe?",5,10
JORAH, The second time thanks to you.,5,10
TYRION," Don’t blame me for your crimes, Mormont.",5,10
DAARIO," (gestures to Tyrion) He’s right. The Queen exiled Jorah. (gestures to Jorah) And he’s right, Jorah saved her life. Perhaps she feels differently about him now. Perhaps not. The only way we’ll know is if we ask her.",5,10
TYRION," Fine, fine, I suppose he can join us. Just as long as he promises not to kill me in my sleep.",5,10
JORAH, If I ever kill you your eyes will be wide open.,5,10
DAARIO (to Tyrion)," Forgive me, but why would we bring you?",5,10
TYRION, Pardon me?,5,10
DAARIO, Have you ever tracked animals in the wilderness?,5,10
TYRION," Not precisely, but I have other skills that’d be very useful--",5,10
DAARIO, Can you fight?,5,10
TYRION, I have fought. I don’t claim to be a great warrior.,5,10
DAARIO, Are you good on a horse?,5,10
TYRION, Middling.,5,10
DAARIO, So mainly you talk?,5,10
TYRION, And drink. I’ve survived so far.,5,10
DAARIO," Which I respect. But you would not help us on this expedition. You would help us here in Meereen, though. (to Missandei, Grey Worm, and Jorah) None of us have any experience governing a city, except for him. You want to prove your value to the queen? Prove it right here in Meereen.",5,10
JORAH, He’s a foreign dwarf that barely speaks the language. Why would the Meereenese listen to him?,5,10
DAARIO, They wouldn’t. They will listen to Grey Worm.,5,10
GREY WORM, I’ll come with you. I’ll find our queen.,5,10
MISSANDEI, You are not strong enough to go anywhere.,5,10
GREY WORM, I am.,5,10
DAARIO," He is, he’s the toughest man with no balls I’ve ever met. But you still can’t go. The people believe in you. They know you speak for the queen.",5,10
MISSANDEI," It’s true. Only the Unsullied can keep the peace in Meereen. If you leave, half the city will consume the other half.",5,10
DAARIO," And Missandei. Our queen trusts no one more than Missandei. Certainly not me. The queen’s closest confidant, the commander of the Unsullied, and the foreign dwarf with the scarred face. Good fortune, my friends, Meereen is ancient and glorious. (to Tyrion) Try not to ruin her. (to Jorah) Looks like it’s you and me, Jorah the Andal. Let’s find some good horses. We have so much to talk about.",5,10
VOICE (O.S.)," Hello, old friend.",5,10
VARYS, I thought we were so happy together until you abandoned me.,5,10
TYRION, I suppose there’s no point in asking how you found me.,5,10
VARYS," The birds sing in the west, the birds sing in the east. If one knows how to listen. They tell me you’ve already found favor with the Mother of Dragons.",5,10
TYRION," Well, she didn’t execute me, so that’s a promising start. Now the heroes are off to find her, and I’m stuck here, trying to placate a city on the brink of civil war. Any advice for an old comrade?",5,10
VARYS, Information is the key. You need to learn your enemies’ strengths and strategies. You need to learn which of your friends are not your friends.,5,10
TYRION, If only I knew someone with a vast network of spies.,5,10
VARYS," If only. (beat) A grand old city, choking on violence, corruption, and deceit. Who could possibly have any experience managing such a massive, ungainly beast?",5,10
TYRION, I did miss you.,5,10
VARYS," Oh, I know.",5,10
DAENERYS, We have to go home.,5,10
DAENERYS," My poor, sweet thing. Does it hurt? (pause) We have to go home. Drogon? Can you take me back to Meereen?",5,10
DAENERYS, How far did you carry me? (surveys the area),5,10
DAENERYS," Drogon, we need to return. My people need me.",5,10

SEPTA, Confess. Confess.,5,10
CERSEI," I have sinned. I see that now. How could I have been so blind for so long. I want to be clean again. I want absolution. The Crone came to me with her lamp raised high, and with its holy light--",5,10
HIGH SPARROW, You wish to make a confession?,5,10
CERSEI," Once I’ve confessed, will I be free?",5,10
SPARROW, Your Grace will be dealt with according to her sins.,5,10

CERSEI, Lancel Lannister.,5,10
SPARROW, Your cousin. And the King’s squire.,5,10
CERSEI, I was lonely and afraid.,5,10
SPARROW, You had a husband.,5,10
CERSEI, A husband of whoring every chance he got.,5,10
SPARROW, His sins do not pardon your own.,5,10
CERSEI, May the gods forgive me.,5,10
SPARROW, Other men?,5,10
CERSEI, No.,5,10
SPARROW, No others?,5,10
CERSEI, No.,5,10
SPARROW, Speaking falsehoods before the Gods is a great crime. You understand this?,5,10
CERSEI, I do.,5,10
SPARROW, There are those who say your children were not fathered by King Robert. That they are bastards born of incest and adultery.,5,10
CERSEI," A lie. A lie from the lips of Stannis Baratheon. He wants the Throne, but his brother’s children stand in his way, so he claims they are not his brothers’. The filth. There is not one shred of truth to it. I deny it.",5,10
SPARROW," Good. But these are terrible charges. And the realm must know the truth of them. If Your Grace has given honest testimony, your trial will prove your innocence.",5,10
CERSEI, Trial? I have confessed?,5,10
SPARROW, To a single sin. Others you have denied. Your trial will separate the truths from the falsehoods.,5,10
CERSEI, I bow to the wisdom of your High Holiness. But if I might beg for just one drop of the Mother’s mercy. I haven’t seen my son… I don’t know how long it’s been. I need to see him. Please.,5,10
SPARROW," You have taken the first step on a path back to righteousness. In light of this, I will permit you to return to the Red Keep.",5,10

CERSEI," I will, I will. I swear it, day and night.",5,10
SPARROW, Good.,5,10
CERSEI, Am I free to go?,5,10
SPARROW, After your atonement.,5,10
CERSEI, My atonement?,5,10
SPARROW," A sinner comes before you. Cersei of House Lannister, mother to his Grace King Tommen, widow to his Grace King Robert. She has committed the acts of falsehood and fornication. She has confessed her sins and begged for forgiveness. To demonstrate her repentance, she will cast aside all pride, all artifice, and present herself as the gods made her, to you. The good people of the city. She comes before you with a solemn heart. Shorn of secrets. Naked before the eyes of gods and men. To make her walk of atonement.",5,10

JON (stands up), Are you sure he’s talking about Benjen?,5,10
OLLY, Says he was first Ranger. Said he knows where to find him.,5,10

NIGHT’S WATCHMAN #2, Traitors!,6,1
ALLISER THORNE, You’re right!,6,1
ALLISER THORNE," We’ve committed treason, all of us. Jon Snow was my Lord Commander. I had no love for him. That was no secret. But I never once disobeyed an order. Loyalty is the foundation on which the Night’s Watch is built, and the Watch means everything to me. I have given my life, we have all given our lives to the Night’s Watch. Jon Snow was going to destroy the Night’s Watch. He let the wildlings through our gates, as no Lord Commander has ever done before. He gave them the very land on which they reaved and raped and murdered. Lord Commander Snow did what he thought was right, I’ve no doubt about that. And what he thought was right would have been the end of us. He thrust a terrible choice upon us, and we made it.",6,1

DAVOS, We don’t have the numbers.,6,1
DOLOROUS EDD, We have a direwolf.,6,1
DAVOS," It’s not enough. I didn’t know Lord Commander Snow for long, but I have to believe he wouldn’t have wanted his friends to die for nothing.",6,1
DOLOROUS EDD," If you were planning to see tomorrow, you picked the wrong room. We all die today. I say we do our best to take Thorne with us when we go.",6,1
DAVOS," We need to fight, but we don’t need to die. Not if we have help.",6,1
NIGHT’S WATCHMAN, Who’s gonna help us?,6,1

RAMSAY," The kennelmaster’s daughter. She smelled of dog. I wasn’t much older, but everybody was already afraid of me. You certainly were.",6,1
RAMSAY," Myranda wasn’t, though. What could I do to her that those hounds couldn’t? She was fearless. There was nothing she wouldn’t do.",6,1
RAMSAY, Your pain will be paid for a thousand times over. I wish you could be here to watch.,6,1
MAESTER WOLKAN," Shall I have a grave dug for her, my lord? Or would you rather the men build a pyre?",6,1
RAMSAY," Buried, burned?",6,1
RAMSAY, This is good meat. Feed it to the hounds.,6,1
CUT TO, WINTERFELL - HALLWAY,6,1
ROOSE," Your command of the cavalry was impressive. Thanks to you, the false king Stannis Baratheon is dead. Do you know who struck the killing blow?",6,1
RAMSAY, No.,6,1
ROOSE," A shame. I’d reward the man. Still, a great victory. Do you feel like a victor?",6,1
ROOSE," I rebelled against the crown to arrange your marriage to Sansa Stark. Do you think that burning wagons in the night and mowing down tired, outnumbered Baratheons is the same as facing a prepared and provisioned Lannister army?",6,1
RAMSAY, No.,6,1
ROOSE, A reckoning will come. We need the North to face it. The entire North. They won’t back us without Sansa Stark. We no longer have Sansa Stark. You played your games with her. You played your games with the heir to the Iron Islands and now they’re both gone.,6,1
RAMSAY, I have a team of men after them with some of my best hounds. They won’t get far.,6,1
ROOSE," I’m glad to hear it. Without Sansa, you won’t be able to produce an heir. And without an heir, well…",6,1
ROOSE, ...let’s hope the maesters are right and Lady Walder’s carrying a boy.,6,1
THEON, We can’t stop.,6,1
THEON, We have to cross here.,6,1
SANSA, I can’t.,6,1
THEON, It’s the only way to throw off the hounds.,6,1

BOLTON OFFICER, Where is Lady Bolton?,6,1
THEON, Dead.,6,1
BOLTON OFFICER, Liar.,6,1
THEON, She broke her leg jumping from the ramparts. I left her to die in the snow.,6,1
BOLTON OFFICER, I can’t wait to see what parts Ramsay cuts off you this time.,6,1
BOLTON OFFICER, It’s a bloody woman.,6,1

CERSEI, Do you remember the first time you saw a dead body?,6,1
JAIME, Mother.,6,1
CERSEI," All I could think about when she died was what would happen to her now. Every day, every night, what does Mama look like now? Has she started to bloat? Has her skin turned black? Have her lips peeled back from her teeth?",6,1
CERSEI, I think about locking Myrcella in a crypt.,6,1
CERSEI, I think about her beautiful little face starting to collapse.,6,1
JAIME," Shh, shh. Don’t think about it.",6,1
CERSEI, I have to. I have to. It’s not right she has to suffer alone.,6,1
JAIME, She’s not suffering. She’s gone. No one can hurt her anymore.,6,1
CERSEI (crying)," She was good. From her first breath, she was so sweet. I don’t know where she came from. She was nothing like me. No meanness, no jealous, just good.",6,1
JAIME, I know.,6,1
CERSEI," I thought if I could make something so good, so pure...maybe I’m not a monster.",6,1
JAIME, Listen -- listen to me. She was my daughter and I failed her.,6,1
CERSEI," No, I knew this would happen. The witch told me years ago. She promised me three children. She promised me they’d die. “And gold their shrouds.” Everything she said came true. You couldn’t have stopped it. It’s prophecy. It’s fate.",6,1
JAIME, You don’t believe that.,6,1
CERSEI," Of course I do. You told me yourself when Father died. You said we had to stay together. You said people would try to tear us apart, take what’s ours. That was a prophecy, too. I didn’t listen to you, and everything you said came true.",6,1
JAIME," Fuck prophecy. Fuck fate. Fuck everyone who isn’t us. We’re the only ones who matter, the only ones in this world. And everything they’ve taken from us, we’re going to take back and more.",6,1

HIGH SPARROW, Septa Unella.,6,1
HIGH SPARROW, Our other guests need you.,6,1
HIGH SPARROW (whispering), There.,6,1
HIGH SPARROW, Septa Unella can be overzealous at times. I’ll speak with her.,6,1
MARGAERY," My brother, can you tell me how he is?",6,1
HIGH SPARROW, It isn’t Ser Loras that brings me here. Your husband misses you dearly. The love between a man and wife is sacred. It reflects the love the gods have for all of us. But sin leads us away from the sacred. And only confession can purge sin.,6,1
MARGAERY, I have nothing to confess.,6,1
HIGH SPARROW, So you believe you are pure? Perfect? Wholly without sin?,6,1
MARGAERY, None of us are.,6,1
HIGH SPARROW, You have started down the path. But you have many miles to go..,6,1
DORAN, I always envied Oberyn. He lived. He truly lived. Sailed around the world. Fought men from every country. Lay with the most beautiful women alive.,6,1
ELLARIA, And men.,6,1
DORAN," And men. He experienced everything, while I sat here in Dorne trying my best to keep my people alive and well fed. But that is life. We each have our roles.",6,1
DORAN, Oberyn was born to be an adventurer. And I was born to rule.,6,1
ELLARIA," The gods are not fools. You would have been a lousy adventurer. And Oberyn, pfft, he would have been a terrible ruler.",6,1
DORAN (to TYENE)," Your mother is a brilliant woman, you know that?",6,1
MAESTER, Prince Doran.,6,1
DORAN, The Princess Myrcella…,6,1
ELLARIA," When was the last time you left this palace? You don’t know your own people. Their disgust for you. Elia Martell raped and murdered, and you did nothing. Oberyn martell butchered, and you did nothing. You’re not a Dornishman. You’re not our prince.",6,1
DORAN, My son Trystane…,6,1
ELLARIA, Your son is weak just like you. And weak men will never rule Dorne again.,6,1

TYRION, We’ll be fine. We’re dressed like common merchants.,6,1
VARYS, You walk like a rich person.,6,1
TYRION, You’ve spent a lot of time studying the way rich people walk?,6,1
VARYS, You walk as though the paving stones were your personal property. I used to steal from people like you when I was a boy.,6,1
TYRION, It’s a good thing you’re not a boy anymore...because you have no cock.,6,1
TYRION (speaking Valyrian), For your baby. To eat.,6,1
VARYS (to TYRION), She thinks you want to eat her baby.,6,1
VARYS (speaking Valyrian)," His Valyrian is terrible. He only wants to give you money, so your baby can eat.",6,1
VARYS, Mhysa means mother in Valyrian.,6,1
TYRION, I know what mhysa means.,6,1
VARYS, Who wrote it?,6,1
TYRION, Hard to know. Our queen is not as popular in Meereen as she used to be.,6,1
VARYS, The Sons of the Harpy?,6,1
TYRION," Very possibly. Daenerys Targaryen took away their most valuable property, told them human beings weren’t even property to begin with. You can see why they’re unhappy. Of course, it could also be the freed men.",6,1
LISTENERS (speaking Valyrian), For the night is dark and full of terrors.,6,1
RED PRIEST," The Lord of Light sent the Mother of Dragons to you, and those who love the darkness chased her away.",6,1
TYRION, Many of the former slaves feel that Daenerys has abandoned them.,6,1
VARYS, She did fly away on a dragon and not come back.,6,1
RED PRIEST," How will you respond? Will you wring your hands, while you wait for the Mother of Dragons to return? Or will you you take up her flames yourselves? Will you fight for your own salvation, now that Queen Daenerys is not here to fight for you?",6,1
TYRION, It’s a problem.,6,1
TYRION," Fear has brought Meereen to a standstill. Whoever you are, wherever you go, someone in this city wants to murder you. We can’t fight an enemy we don’t know.",6,1
VARYS," The Sons of the Harpy planned their attack in the fighting pits very carefully, which means they take orders from someone.",6,1
TYRION, And have you started looking for that someone?,6,1
VARYS," My little birds have already taken wing. Soon they’ll return, singing songs of men in gold masks.",6,1
TYRION," Well, we won’t be sailing to Westeros anytime soon.",6,1

JORAH, Ram.,6,1
DAARIO, You think our friend got him?,6,1
JORAH, Don’t know anything else that can melt a ram’s horn.,6,1
DAARIO," We’re on the right path, then.",6,1
DAARIO, Perhaps she’s tired of being queen. I don’t think she likes it very much.,6,1
JORAH, She’s too smart to like it.,6,1
DAARIO," Maybe she’s flown somewhere else, somewhere far away from men like us.",6,1
JORAH, I’ve been all over the world. There’s no escaping men like us.,6,1
DAARIO," There’s no escaping her, eh? You keep coming back. Why?",6,1
JORAH, You know why.,6,1
DAARIO, isn’t it frustrating wanting someone who doesn’t want you back?,6,1
JORAH, Of course it is.,6,1
DAARIO," You’re a romantic. I admire that. Sometimes I look at you and I think, “So that’s what I’ll be like when I grow old.”",6,1
JORAH, If you grow old.,6,1
DAARIO, If I grow old. I hope I do. I want to see what the world looks like when she’s done conquering it.,6,1
JORAH, So do I.,6,1
DAARIO," Huh, an army?",6,1
JORAH, Not an army. A horde.,6,1
DAARIO, Dothraki?,6,1
JORAH, They have her.,6,1
BLOODRIDER #1, Maybe she saw a ghost. My friend’s mother saw a ghost and her hair turned white.,6,1
BLOODRIDER #2, Pink people are afraid of the sun. It burns their skin. This one stands too long in the sun and her hair goes white.,6,1
BLOODRIDER #1, You think she’s got white pussy hair too? You ever been with a girl with white pussy hair?,6,1
BLOODRIDER #2, Only when I was fucking your grandma.,6,1
BLOODRIDER #1 (to DAENERYS), I’ll ask Khal Moro for a night with you. What do you think?,6,1
BLOODRIDER #2," Pretty eyes, but she’s an idiot.",6,1

WIFE#1," Cut off her head, before she casts a spell on you.",6,1
KHAL MORO," Even if I was blind, I’d hear my wives say, “Cut off her head” and I’d know this woman was beautiful. I’m glad I’m not blind. Seeing a beautiful woman naked for the first time, what is better than that?",6,1
BLOODRIDER #3, Killing another Khal?,6,1
KHAL MORO," Yes, killing another Khal.",6,1
BLOODRIDER #4," Conquering a city and taking her people as slaves, and taking her idols back to Vaes Dothrak.",6,1
BLOODRIDER #3," Breaking a wild horse, forcing it to submit to your will.",6,1
KHAL MORO (annoyed), Seeing a beautiful woman naked for the first time is among the five best things in life.,6,1
DAENERYS (speaking Dothraki), Do not touch me.,6,1
DAENERYS," I am Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, the Unburnt, Queen of Meereen, Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar of the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons.",6,1
KHAL MORO," You are nobody, the millionth of your name, Queen of Nothing, slave of Khal Moro. Tonight I will lie with you, and if the Great Stallion is kind, you will give me a son. Do you understand?",6,1
DAENERYS," I will not lie with you. And I will bear no children, for you, or anyone else. Not until the sun rises in the west, and sets in the east.",6,1
WIFE #1, I told you she was a witch. Cut off her head.,6,1
KHAL MORO, I like her. She has spirit.,6,1
DAENERYS," I was wife of Khal Drogo, son of Khal Bharbo.",6,1
KHAL MORO, Khal Drogo is dead.,6,1
DAENERYS, I know. I burnt his body.,6,1
KHAL MORO, Forgive me. I did not know. It is forbidden to lie with a Khal’s widow. No one will touch you. You have my word.,6,1
DAENERYS," If you will escort me back to Meereen, I will see that your khalasar is given a thousand horses, as a sign of my gratitude.",6,1

WAIF," Are you listening, blind girl? Do you hear them talking? Do any of them talk to you? No. So sad.",6,1

ALLISER THORNE, What?,6,1
DAVOS, I’m not much of a hunter. I’ll need some food if I’m gonna make it south without starving.,6,1
ALLISER THORNE," We’ll give you food. You can bring the Red Woman with you if you like. Or you can leave her here with us, whichever you choose. But surrender by nightfall or this ends with blood.",6,1

YOUNG RODRIK," Give him another go, Ned.",6,2
BRAN (to THREE-EYED RAVEN), That’s my father. And my Uncle Benjen.,6,2
YOUNG NED (to YOUNG BENJEN), Keep your shield up or I’ll ring your head like a bell.,6,2
BRAN, They were all so happy.,6,2
THREE-EYED RAVEN, So were you once.,6,2
YOUNG NED, Stop showing off.,6,2
YOUNG BENJEN, Lyanna!,6,2
BRAN, My Aunt Lyanna. I’ve seen her statue in the crypt. My father never talked about her.,6,2
YOUNG BENJEN, Would you get out of here? We’re sparring.,6,2
YOUNG LYANNA, Who are you gonna spar with when Ned goes off to the Eyrie?,6,2
YOUNG BENJEN, I don’t know.,6,2
YOUNG LYANNA, What about him?,6,2
YOUNG NED," Wylis, come here.",6,2
BRAN, Hodor?,6,2
YOUNG BENJEN, But he’s got giant’s blood.,6,2
YOUNG NED, And you’ve got training. Sounds like a fair match to me.,6,2
YOUNG LYANNA, Benjen always lifts his chin when he’s about to charge.,6,2
YOUNG HODOR," And lowers it when he’s going to dodge, my lady.",6,2
BRAN, Hodor talks?,6,2
NAN," You leave the fighting to the little lords, Wylis. Come along, now. It’s no place for you.",6,2
YOUNG NED," Oh, Nan, look at the size of him. If he ever learned to fight, he’d be unstoppable.",6,2
NAN," Well, he’s never going to learn to fight because he’s a stable boy. So leave him be.",6,2
THREE-EYED RAVEN (to BRAN), It is time to go.,6,2
BRAN," Please, a little longer.",6,2
CUT TO, GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE,6,2
BRAN, You finally show me something I care about and then you drag me away.,6,2

BRAN, I wasn’t drowning. I was home.,6,2
BRAN, Wylis.,6,2
HODOR, Hodor.,6,2
BRAN, I saw you as a boy. You could talk. What happened?,6,2
HODOR, Hodor.,6,2
BRAN, Where’s Meera?,6,2
HODOR, Hodor.,6,2
BRAN, You shouldn’t be here. It’s not safe outside the cave.,6,2
MEERA, It’s not safe anywhere.,6,2
BRAN, I saw that Hodor wasn’t always Hodor.,6,2
HODOR, Hodor.,6,2
BRAN, His real name is Wylis. And he could talk and fight and -- and then --,6,2
BRAN, What’s wrong?,6,2
BRAN, The Three-Eyed Raven says there’s a war coming.,6,2
MEERA, And we’re going to fight it in there.,6,2
CHILD OF THE FOREST, Brandon Stark needs you.,6,2
MEERA, For what? I sit in there and I watch him have his visions and nothing ever happens.,6,2
CHILD OF THE FOREST, He isn’t going to stay there forever. And out there he needs you.,6,2
ALLISER THORNE," It’s time, Ser Davos. Open the door and the men inside can rejoin their brothers in peace. We’ll even set the wolf free north of the Wall where it belongs. Nobody needs to die tonight.",6,2
DAVOS, I’ve never been much of a fighter.,6,2
DAVOS, Apologies for what you’re about to see.,6,2
ALLISER THORNE, Come on.,6,2
ALLISER THORNE, Attack!,6,2
ALLISER THORNE," Fight, you cowards!",6,2
ALLISER THORNE (to DOLOROUS EDD), You fucking traitor.,6,2
DOLOROUS EDD, The only traitors here are the ones who shoved their knives into their Lord Commander’s heart.,6,2
ALLISER THORNE, For thousands of years the Night’s Watch has held Castle Black against the Wildlings.,6,2
TORMUND, Until you.,6,2
DOLOROUS EDD, Throw them into the cells where they belong.,6,2
TORMUND, Took a lot of knives. I’ll have my men get the wood for a fire. Bodies to burn.,6,2
STORYTELLER," Right, so there she is, high and mighty Queen Cersei, tits and ass jiggling in the breeze.",6,2
STORYTELLER," All of a sudden she looks my way. Gives me a little smile like, “Well?” So, all right, you know, I’ve never been shy and I’m blessed down south, so I put it right out. She’s never seen anything like it. I mean, she’s used to her brother, and from what I hear, Jaime Lannister’s half an inch shy of an inch. She sees it and I swear to the gods she licks her lips. Well, you all know me. You know I wouldn’t lie about this.",6,2
CUT TO, RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER,6,2
CERSEI, Get out of my way.,6,2
KING’S SOLDIER," King’s orders, Your Grace.",6,2

CUT TO, KING'S LANDING - GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR,6,2
TOMMEN, She grew up.,6,2
JAIME, Almost.,6,2
TOMMEN, Have we caught Prince Trystane’s killers? I expect it was Mother.,6,2
JAIME, Your mother wouldn’t do that.,6,2
TOMMEN," Yes, she would.",6,2
JAIME, Are you angry with her?,6,2
TOMMEN, Of course not.,6,2
JAIME, Then why didn’t you let her come? She has every right to be here.,6,2
TOMMEN, They told me she wouldn’t be allowed in the sept. If she had tried --,6,2
JAIME," They’re not putting your mother in a cell ever again. Not while I’m here. Why haven’t you gone to see her? Everything she endured, she did it for you.",6,2
TOMMEN, Don’t you think I know that? I’m sorry. But I can’t.,6,2
JAIME, Why not?,6,2
TOMMEN," When the Faith Militant seized her and Margaery, what did I do? When they paraded her through the streets like a whore, what did I do?",6,2
JAIME, We all fail sometimes.,6,2
TOMMEN," The king is supposed to be the Protector of the Realm. If I can’t even protect my own wife or my own mother, what good am I?",6,2
JAIME, Go and see your mother and ask her to forgive you.,6,2
HIGH SPARROW, Your Grace. Lord Commander.,6,2
TOMMEN, I want to see my wife.,6,2
HIGH SPARROW, The gods wait for Queen Margaery to confess her crimes and seek their mercy. The king must wait as well.,6,2
JAIME," Go and see your mother, Tommen.",6,2
JAIME, You’re a bold man.,6,2
HIGH SPARROW," On the contrary. I fear a great deal. The Father, the Mother, the Warrior.",6,2
HIGH SPARROW, Do you know why we use these stones? To remind us not to fear death. We close our eyes on this world and open them on the next.,6,2
JAIME, You must long for the next life.,6,2
HIGH SPARROW," In truth, I fear that, too.",6,2
JAIME, You imprisoned and humiliated my sister.,6,2
HIGH SPARROW, Your sister sought the gods’ mercy and atoned for her sin.,6,2
JAIME, What about my sins?,6,2
JAIME," I broke a sacred oath and stabbed my king in the back. I killed my own cousin. When the gods judged my brother guilty, I helped him escape their justice. What atonement do I deserve?",6,2
HIGH SPARROW, You would spill blood in this holy place?,6,2
JAIME," Oh, the gods won’t mind. They’ve spilled more blood than the rest of us combined.",6,2
HIGH SPARROW," Go on, then. I deserve it. We all do. We are weak, vain creatures. We live only by the Mother’s mercy.",6,2
JAIME, They should be closer if you mean for them to save you.,6,2
HIGH SPARROW, I don’t. They’d never reach me before you struck.,6,2
JAIME, I’ve fought against worse odds.,6,2
HIGH SPARROW," No doubt many of us would fall. But who are we, hmm? We have no names, no family. Every one of us is poor and powerless. And yet together, we can overthrow an empire.",6,2
CUT TO, RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER,6,2
TOMMEN, Mother.,6,2
CERSEI, Did they put her in the red gown or the gold?,6,2
TOMMEN, Gold.,6,2
CERSEI, Good. It was always her color.,6,2
TOMMEN," I’m sorry for keeping you here. I shouldn’t have, but I was -- I didn’t want to lose you again.",6,2
CERSEI, I understand. I’m glad to see you.,6,2
TOMMEN, I know I should have come sooner. I wanted to. I was wrong.,6,2
CERSEI, It’s all right.,6,2
TOMMEN," No, it isn’t.",6,2
TOMMEN," I should have executed all of them. I should have pulled down the sept onto the High Sparrow’s head before I let them do that to you, as you would have for me. You raised me to be strong...and I wasn’t. But I want to be. Help me.",6,2
CERSEI, Always.,6,2
CUT TO, GREAT PYRAMID - ROYAL CHAMBERS,6,2
TYRION," If I lost my cock, I’d drink all the time.",6,2
TYRION," Meaning no offense. He makes dwarf jokes, I make eunuch jokes.",6,2
VARYS, I do not make dwarf jokes.,6,2
TYRION, You think them.,6,2
VARYS," So, the fleet. It’s been burned.",6,2
GREY WORM," We are searching for the men who burned the ships, but nobody saw anything.",6,2
TYRION, Surely there’s some good news lurking somewhere.,6,2
VARYS, Astapor and Yunkai have stopped asking us for aid.,6,2
TYRION, Perhaps they can tell us their secret.,6,2
VARYS," The Masters have retaken both cities. Outside of Meereen, the whole of Slaver’s Bay has returned to the slavers.",6,2
TYRION, What about the dragons? We have two of them here beneath the pyramid.,6,2
MISSANDEI, They are not eating. They haven’t touched any food since Queen Daenerys left.,6,2
TYRION," Daenerys is the dragon queen. Can’t very well let the dragons starve, that’s obvious.",6,2
GREY WORM," If a dragon does not want to eat, how do you force him to eat?",6,2
TYRION, Dragons do not do well in captivity.,6,2
MISSANDEI, How do you know this?,6,2
TYRION, That’s what I do. I drink and I know things.,6,2
TYRION," The dragons Aegon used to conquer Westeros ranged over hundreds of miles. Then Daenerys’s ancestors started chaining them up in pens. A few generations later, the last dragons were no larger than cats. They must be unchained or they’ll waste away. Missandei, how many times were you in the company of these dragons?",6,2
MISSANDEI, Many times.,6,2
TYRION, And did they ever harm you?,6,2
MISSANDEI, Never.,6,2
TYRION, Dragons are intelligent. More intelligent than men according to some maesters. They have affection for their friends and fury for their enemies. I am their friend.,6,2
VARYS, Do they know that?,6,2
TYRION, They will. It’s time they had their supper.,6,2
CUT TO, MEEREEN - CATACOMBS,6,2
TYRION (to RHAEGAL), I’m friends with your mother. I’m here to help. Don’t eat the help.,6,2
TYRION," When I was a child an uncle asked what gift I wanted for my name day. I begged him for one of you. “It wouldn’t even have to be a big dragon,” I told him. “It could be little, like me.”",6,2
TYRION, Everyone laughed like it was the funniest thing they had ever heard. Then my father told me the last dragon had died a century ago. I cried myself to sleep that night.,6,2
TYRION, But here you are.,6,2
TYRION," Next time I have an idea like that, punch me in the face.",6,2
WAIF, What’s your name?,6,2
WAIF, What’s your name?,6,2
ARYA, No one.,6,2
WAIF, I don’t believe that.,6,2
WAIF, You don’t believe that.,6,2
JAQEN, Who are you?,6,2
ARYA, No one.,6,2
JAQEN," If a girl says her name, a man will let her sleep under a roof tonight.",6,2
ARYA, A girl has no name.,6,2
JAQEN," If a girl says her name, a man will feed her tonight.",6,2
ARYA, A girl has no name.,6,2
JAQEN," If a girl says her name, a man will give her eyes back.",6,2
ARYA, A girl has no name.,6,2
JAQEN, Come.,6,2
JAQEN, Leave it. A girl is not a beggar anymore.,6,2
LORD KARSTARK, He came upon the bodies on our way here.,6,2
ROOSE, Half a dozen men? Your best hunters?,6,2
RAMSAY, They obviously had help.,6,2
ROOSE," I didn’t think lady Sansa killed them all by herself. Thank you for this report, Lord Kastark.",6,2
RAMSAY, We know where she’s going. Her brother’s at Castle Black.,6,2
LORD KARSTARK, Ned Stark’s last surviving son?,6,2
ROOSE," Jon Snow is a bastard, not a Stark.",6,2
RAMSAY," So was I, Father.",6,2
LORD KARSTARK, Your hold on the North will never be secure as long as a Stark can walk through that door.,6,2
RAMSAY," Castle Black isn’t defended on the southern side. And the few men left are barely men at all. Farm boys and thieves. With a small force we could storm the castle, kill Jon Snow --",6,2
ROOSE, Murder the Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch? You’d unite every house in the North against us.,6,2
RAMSAY," We don’t need every house in the North. The Umbers, the Manderlys, and the Karstarks. command more soldiers than all the other houses combined. With their support, none could challenge us.",6,2
LORD KARSTARK, The Starks lost my house the day King Rob cut off my father’s head. It’s time for new blood in the North.,6,2
ROOSE," If you acquire a reputation as a mad dog, you’ll be treated as a mad dog. Taken out back and slaughtered for pig feed.",6,2
MAESTER WOLKAN, My lords. Lady Walda has given birth. A boy. Red-cheeked and healthy.,6,2
LORD KARSTARK," My congratulations, Lord Bolton.",6,2
RAMSEY," Congratulations, Father. I look forward to meeting my new brother.",6,2
ROOSE, You’ll always be my firstborn.,6,2
RAMSAY, Thank you for saying that. It means a great deal to me.,6,2

RAMSAY, How did he die?,6,2
MAESTER WOLKAN, Poisoned by his enemies.,6,2
LORD KARSTARK, You're talking to your lord. Use respect.,6,2
MAESTER WOLKAN," Forgive me, my lord.",6,2
RAMSAY, Send for Lady Walda and the baby.,6,2
MAESTER WOLKAN," She’s resting, my lord.",6,2
MAESTER WOLKAN," At once, my lord.",6,2
CUT TO, WINTERFELL - COMMONS,6,2
RAMSAY, There he is.,6,2
LADY WALDA, Isn’t he wonderful?,6,2
RAMSEY, May I hold him?,6,2
LADY WALDA, Of course.,6,2
RAMSAY, Little brother.,6,2
LADY WALDA, Lord Bolton sent for us. Have you seen him?,6,2
RAMSAY," Of course. Follow me, Mother.",6,2
LADY WALDA, Where is Lord Bolton?,6,2
RAMSAY (to the dogs), Down!,6,2
LADY WALDA," It’s all right. Come on, shh.",6,2
LADY WALDA," It’s cold out here, Ramsay. I need to feed him.",6,2
LADY WALDA," Ramsay, where is your father? Ramsay? Where is Lord Bolton?",6,2
RAMSAY, I am Lord Bolton.,6,2
LADY WALDA," Ramsay. Ramsay, please. I’ll leave Winterfell. I’ll go back to the Riverlands. Please. Ramsay. He’s your brother.",6,2
RAMSEY, I prefer being an only child.,6,2
BRIENNE," I saw her with a man. I don’t think he hurt her. She didn’t want to leave him, he didn’t want to leave her.",6,2
SANSA, You don’t know which way she went?,6,2
BRIENNE, I spent three days looking for her. She disappeared.,6,2
SANSA, How did she look?,6,2
BRIENNE, She looked good. She wasn’t exactly dressed like a lady.,6,2
SANSA," No, she wouldn’t be.",6,2
BRIENNE, What happened at Winterfell?,6,2
SANSA, I should’ve gone with you while I had the chance.,6,2
BRIENNE," It was a difficult choice, my lady.",6,2
BRIENNE, We’ve all had to make difficult choices.,6,2
THEON, We shouldn’t be lighting fires. It’s not safe. He won’t stop hunting us.,6,2
SANSA," We just have to make it to Castle Black. Once we’re with Jon, Ramsay won’t be able to touch us.",6,2
THEON, Jon will have me killed the moment I step through the gate.,6,2
SANSA, I won’t let him. I’ll tell him the truth about Bran and Rickon.,6,2
THEON," And the truth about the farm boys I killed in their place? The truth about Ser Rodrik, who I beheaded?",6,2
THEON," And the truth about Rob, who I betrayed?",6,2
SANSA," When you take the black, all your crimes are forgiven.",6,2
THEON, I don’t want to be forgiven. I can never make amends to your family for all the things that I’ve done. They’ll keep you safer than I ever could.,6,2
SANSA, You’re not coming with us?,6,2
THEON, I would have taken you all the way to the Wall. I would have died to get you there.,6,2
THEON, May I take one of the horses?,6,2
SANSA, Where will you go?,6,2
THEON, Home.,6,2
CUT TO, PYKE CASTLE - GREAT HALL,6,2
YARA, The Glovers have retaken Deepwood Motte.,6,2
BALON, And the Ironborn who held it?,6,2
YARA, They died fighting to a man.,6,2
BALON, What is dead may never die.,6,2
YARA, What is dead may never die.,6,2
YARA, But they did and our invasion died with them. Deepwood Motte was our last stronghold on the mainland.,6,2
BALON, They we will take more.,6,2
YARA, Why? For more pinecones and rocks?,6,2
BALON, Because I order it.,6,2
YARA," We can defeat anyone at sea, but we’ll never hold lands and castles against mainland armies.",6,2
BALON," Not if our captains defy my orders, abandon their posts, and sacrifice our men on foolish mission.",6,2
YARA, I won’t apologize for trying to rescue Theon.,6,2
BALON, Then where is he?,6,2
YARA," Where is your kingdom? We took those castles because the northerners marched off to war. That war is over. The last time we provoked them too far, I watched from that window as they breached our walls and knocked down our towers. I lost two brothers that day.",6,2
BALON," And I lost three sons. The War of the Five Kings, they call it. Well, the other four are dead. When you rule the Iron Islands, you can wage all the peace you wan. But for now, shut your mouth and obey or I will make another heir who will.",6,2
CUT TO, PYKE CASTLE - BRIDGE,6,2
BALON," Let me pass. You fool, move aside for your king.",6,2
HOODED FIGURE," Haven’t I always, brother?",6,2
BALON, I thought you’d be rotting under some foreign sea by now.,6,2
EURON, What is dead may never die.,6,2
EURON, Has the custom changed since I’ve been gone? Aren’t you supposed to repeat the words?,6,2
BALON, You can mock our god without my help.,6,2
EURON," I don’t mock the Drowned God. I am the Drowned God. From Oldtown to Qarth, when men see my sails, they pray.",6,2
EURON," You’re old, brother. You've had your time. Now let another rule.",6,2
BALON, I heard you lost your mind during the storm on the Jade Sea. They tied you to the mast to keep you from jumping overboard.,6,2
EURON, They did.,6,2
BALON," And when the storm passed, you cut out their tongues.",6,2
EURON, I needed silence.,6,2
BALON, What kind of an Ironborn loses his senses during a storm?,6,2
EURON," I am the storm, brother. The first storm and the last. And you’re in my way.",6,2
CUT TO, PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY,6,2
AERON," Lord, take your servant Balon back beneath the waves. Feed the creatures of your kingdom on his flesh. Pull his bones down to your depths to rest beside his ancestors and his children.",6,2
ALL, What is dead may never die.,6,2
YARA, I’m going to find out who did this. I’m going to feed them to the sharks while they live. I swear it by the Salt Throne.,6,2
AERON," The Salt Throne is not yours to swear upon, not unless the kingsmoot chooses you.",6,2
YARA, My father would’ve wanted me to rule.,6,2
AERON, Your father does not get to choose. The law is clear. Perhaps you'll win. Perhaps you’ll be the first woman in history to rule the Ironborn. And perhaps not.,6,2
MELISANDRE, Come in.,6,2
DAVOS," I'm sorry, my lady. I didn’t mean to interrupt.",6,2
MELISANDRE, You interrupt nothing.,6,2
DAVOS, I assume you know why I’m here.,6,2
MELISANDRE, I will after you tell me.,6,2
DAVOS, It’s about the Lord Commander.,6,2
MELISANDRE, The former Lord Commander.,6,2
DAVOS, Does he have to be?,6,2
MELISANDRE, What are you asking?,6,2
DAVOS, Do you know of any magic...that could help him? Bring him back?,6,2
MELISANDRE," If you want to help him, leave him be.",6,2
DAVOS, Can it be done?,6,2
MELISANDRE, There are some with his power.,6,2
DAVOS, How?,6,2
MELISANDRE, I don’t know.,6,2
DAVOS, Have you seen it done?,6,2
MELISANDRE," I met a man who came back from the dead, but the priest who did it -- It shouldn’t have been possible.",6,2
DAVOS, But it was. It could be now.,6,2
MELISANDRE, Not for me.,6,2
DAVOS, Not for you? I saw you drink poison that should’ve killed you. I saw you give birth to a demon made of shadows.,6,2
MELISANDRE," Everything I believed, the great victory I saw in the flames, all of it was a lie.",6,2
MELISANDRE, You were right all along. The Lord never spoke to me.,6,2
DAVOS," Fuck him, then. Fuck all of them. I’m not a devout man, obviously. Seven Gods, drowned gods, tree gods, it's all the same.",6,2
DAVOS, I’m not asking the Lord of Light for help.I’m asking the woman who showed me that miracles exist.,6,2
MELISANDRE, I never had this gift.,6,2
DAVOS, Have you ever tried?,6,2
CUT TO, CASTLE BLACK - ROOM,6,2
MELISANDRE, Please.,6,2
DAVOS," Easy, easy. Easy.",6,3
DAVOS, What do you remember?,6,3
JON SNOW, They stabbed me. Olly...he put a knife in my heart. I shouldn’t be here.,6,3
DAVOS, The lady brought you back.,6,3
MELISANDRE," Afterwards, after they stabbed you, after you died, where did you go? What did you see?",6,3
JON SNOW, Nothing. There was nothing at all.,6,3
MELISANDRE," The Lord let you come back for a reason. Stannis was not the prince who was promised, but someone has to be.",6,3
DAVOS (to MELISANDRE), Could you give us a moment?,6,3
DAVOS," You were dead. And now you’re not. That’s completely fucking mad, seems to me. I can only imagine how it seems to you.",6,3
JON SNOW, I did what I thought was right. And I got murdered for it. And now I’m back. Why?,6,3
DAVOS, I don’t know. Maybe we’ll never know. What does it matter? You go on. You fight for as long as you can. You clean up as much of the shit as you can.,6,3
JON SNOW," I don’t know how to do that. I thought I did, but...I failed.",6,3
DAVOS, Good. Now go fail again.,6,3
CUT TO, CASTLE BLACK - COURTYARD,6,3
TORMUND, They think you’re some kind of god. The man who returned from the dead.,6,3
JON SNOW, I’m not a god.,6,3
TORMUND, I know that.,6,3
TORMUND, I saw your pecker. What kind of god would have a pecker that small?,6,3
DOLOROUS EDD, Your eyes are still brown. Is that still you in there?,6,3
JON SNOW, I think so. Hold off on burning my body for now.,6,3
DOLOROUS EDD, That’s funny. You sure that’s still you in there?,6,3
CUT TO, VESSEL - HOLD,6,3
GILLY, You all right?,6,3
SAMWELL," Yes. Yes, I’m fine.",6,3
GILLY, Did I ever tell you I used to think the sea was called the see because it was nothing but water as far as the eye could see?,6,3
SAMWELL, I don’t think so.,6,3
GILLY," Sea, see. They’re spelled different, but they sound the same.",6,3
SAMWELL," Yeah, they do.",6,3
GILLY," It was before I learned how to read, obviously.",6,3
GILLY," Sam, are you going to be sick?",6,3
GILLY, Won’t be long. We’ll be in the south soon. I’m excited to see Oldtown. Captain says it’s the most beautiful city in Westeros. Are you going to vomit again?,6,3
SAMWELL," No. No, no, no. The Citadel doesn’t admit women. There won’t be a place for you there or for Little Sam.",6,3
GILLY, I stayed at Castle Black. There’s no women allowed there.,6,3
SAMWELL, The Citadel isn’t Castle Black. I don’t have a Jon Snow or a Maester Aemon to help me bend the rules.,6,3
GILLY," I’ll stay in Oldtown, then.",6,3
SAMWELL, By yourself? With a baby and no money?,6,3
GILLY," So if we’re not going to Oldtown, where are you taking me?",6,3
SAMWELL," To my home. Horn Hill. My father’s -- well, my father, but my mother’s a kind woman and my sister’s lovely. They’ll take care of you both.",6,3
GILLY," “Wherever you go, I go, too.” That’s what you said.",6,3
SAMWELL, I said that because I want you and Little Same to be safe. That’s all I want -- to become a maester so I can help Jon when the time comes so you’ll be safe,6,3
GILLY, Us and everyone else in the world.,6,3
SAMWELL," I don’t care about them. Well, no, I do, but I don’t really. I care about you and him.",6,3
GILLY," I know that, Sam. And he does, too. You're the only one who ever has.",6,3
GILLY," If you think it’s for the best, we trust you.",6,3
SAMWELL, I’d feel better if you threw something at me and stormed off.,6,3
GILLY, I’d never do that to the father of my son.,6,3
BRAN, That’s my father.,6,3

ARTHUR, Lord Stark.,6,3
NED, I looked for you on the Trident.,6,3
ARTHUR, We weren’t there.,6,3
KINGSGUARD, Your friend the usurper would lie beneath the ground if we had been.,6,3
NED, The Mad King is dead. Rhaegar lies beneath the ground. Why weren’t you there to protect your prince?,6,3
ARTHUR, Our prince wanted us here.,6,3
NED, Where’s my sister?,6,3
ARTHUR, I wish you good fortune in the wars to come.,6,3
ARTHUR, And now it begins.,6,3
NED, No. Now it ends.,6,3
BRAN, He’s better than my father.,6,3
THREE-EYED RAVEN, Far better.,6,3
BRAN, But Father beat him.,6,3
THREE-EYED RAVEN, Did he?,6,3
BRAN, I know he did. Heard the story a thousand times.,6,3
BRAN, He stabbed him in the back.,6,3
BRAN, What’s in the tower?,6,3
THREE-EYED RAVEN, That’s enough for one day. We’ll visit again another time.,6,3
BRAN, I want to see where he’s going.,6,3
THREE-EYED RAVEN, Time to go.,6,3
BRAN, Father!,6,3
CUT TO, GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE,6,3
BRAN, Why did you do that? Take me back there. I want to go back.,6,3
THREE-EYED RAVEN, No.,6,3
BRAN, He heard me.,6,3
THREE-EYED RAVEN, Maybe. Maybe he heard the wind.,6,3
BRAN, He heard me.,6,3
THREE-EYED RAVEN, The past is already written. The ink is dry.,6,3
BRAN, What’s in that tower? I want to go back there.,6,3
THREE-EYED RAVEN," I’ve told you many times, stay too long where you don’t belong and you will never return.",6,3
BRAN, Why do I want to return? So I can be a cripple again? So I can talk to an old man in a tree?,6,3
THREE-EYED RAVEN," You think I wanted to sit here for 1,000 years watching the world from a distance as the roots grew through me?",6,3
BRAN, So why did you?,6,3
THREE-EYED RAVEN, I was waiting for you.,6,3
BRAN, I don’t want to be you.,6,3
THREE-EYED RAVEN," I don’t blame you. You won’t be here forever. You won’t be an old man in a tree. But before you leave, you must learn.",6,3
BRAN, Learn what?,6,3
THREE-EYED RAVEN, Everything.,6,3
BLOODRIDER (speaking Dothraki)," Hey, Great Khaleesi. Move your ass.",6,3
KHAL MORO," Welcome home, Khaleesi.",6,3
DOTHRAKI WOMAN, Go.,6,3
DAENERYS, What are you doing?! Take your hands off me! I will have your heads!,6,3
DAENERYS, You have made a mistake. One you will regret. I am the wife of the Great Khal.,6,3
DOTHRAKI MATRON, We know who you are. I remember you eating the stallion’s heart. Why didn’t you come to us after Khal Drogo died?,6,3
DAENERYS," Because I am Daenerys Stormborn, the Breaker of Chains, the Queen of Meereen and the Mother of Dragons. My place is not here with you.",6,3
DOTHRAKI MATRON," You were the wife of the Great Khal. You thought he would conquer the world with you at his side. He didn’t. I was the wife of the Great Khal. Khal Savo. I thought he would conquer the world with me at his side. You’re young. We were all young once. But we all understand the way things are. You will learn as well, if you are fortunate enough to stay with us.",6,3
DAENERYS, Where else would I go? Every khaleesi becomes Dosh Khaleen.,6,3
DOTHRAKI MATRON," Yes. Immediately after the death of their khal. But you went out into the world. That is forbidden. All the khalasars have returned for the Khalar Vezhven. They will decide which cities will be sacked and which tribes will be enslaved. And now they must decide what to do with Khal Drogo’s silver-haired widow. With luck, your place will be here with us, Mother of Dragons. It is the best you can hope for, now.",6,3
VARYS (to an Unsullied), I don’t know how you stand it in all that leather.,6,3
VARYS, If we could have the room.,6,3
VARYS," You look lovely today, my dear. You really do. How you climbed all those steps without breaking a sweat.",6,3
WOMAN," If you’re going to torture me, just call them back and get on with it.",6,3
VARYS, I am not a torturer.,6,3
VARYS, Though it so often is what people deserve.,6,3
VARYS," And it does provide answers. But they’re usually the wrong answers. My job is to find the right answers. Do you know how I do that? I do it by making people happy. I’d like to make you happy, Vala. That’s your name, isn’t it, Vala?",6,3
VARYS," That’s all right. I know who you are and what you’ve done. You’ve done a lot. You’ve sacrificed your body for a cause, which is more than most people do. And you’ve helped the Sons of the Harpy murder the Unsullied and the Second Sons.",6,3
VALA, The Unsullied and the Second Songs are foreign soldiers brought here by a foreign queen to destroy our city and our history.,6,3
VARYS," I understand. Well, that makes perfect sense from your perspective. I have a different perspective, of course. I think it’s important that you try to see things from my perspective just as I will try to see them from yours. Because that is the only way that I can make you and Dom happy. That is how you pronounce it -- Dom? I’m afraid I don’t really speak the language. Such a handsome boy. Those big, brown eyes. Good luck keeping the ladies away.",6,3
VALA," Yes, you’re a true liberator, aren’t you? You won’t torture me, you’ll just threaten my son.",6,3
VARYS," Children are blameless. I have never hurt them. Your boy is in no immediate danger, this I swear to you. But between us, dear, you did conspire to kill the queen’s soldiers. We both know the penalty for that crime. How will poor Dom get on without his mother? And with his breathing problem.",6,3
VALA," If I tell you anything, they’ll kill me. So either you kill me or they do.",6,3
VARYS," Yes, from your perspective, this is a problem. There is a third option, though. A ship leaving tomorrow for Pentos. I’ve already booked passage for a woman and her young son. I’ll even throw in a bag of silver to help you start again.",6,3
VARYS, Though I’m afraid we’ll have to ask one of our leather-clad friends back in to carry it. Far too heavy for me. The boat sails at dawn. You need to decide now. A new life for you and Dom or…,6,3
CUT TO, MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER,6,3
TYRION," What should we do while we wait? To pass the time, what should we do? What should we talk about?",6,3
TYRION (to MISSANDEI), You speak 19 languages. You must occasionally use some of them to talk about things.,6,3
TYRION," You two, you spend a great deal of time together. What would you be talking about if I weren’t here?",6,3
GREY WORM, Patrol. When I am going on patrol with the Unsullied. What we see on patrol. Who we captured on patrol.,6,3
TYRION, That’s good. That’s very good.,6,3
TYRION, But that’s a report. I was thinking more of a conversation. A wise man once said the truth history of the world is the history of great conversation in elegant rooms.,6,3
MISSANDEI, Who said this?,6,3
TYRION," Me. Just now. All right, no conversations. Let’s play a game.",6,3
TYRION," You don’t play games, either one of you, ever?",6,3
GREY WORM, Games are for children.,6,3
MISSANDEI, My master Kraznys would sometimes make us play games.,6,3
TYRION," There, that’s a start.",6,3
MISSANDEI, Only the girls.,6,3
TYRION," Oh no, no, no. Not that, of course not that. Innocent games, fun games, drinking games.",6,3
MISSANDEI, We do not drink.,6,3
TYRION, Until you do.,6,3
TYRION," Alright. No drinking. We can play without drinking. It’s a wonderful game. I invented it. Here’s how it works. I make a statement about your past. If I’m wrong, I drink. And if I’m right -- Maybe we can’t play without drinking.",6,3
TYRION," Oh, you took your time.",6,3
VARYS, Sorry. I was busy learning who funds the Sons of the Harpy. Some things you can’t rush.,6,3
MISSANDEI, You found out?,6,3
VARYS, The good masters of Astapor. And the wise masters of Yunkai. With help from their friends in Volantis.,6,3
TYRION, You see? You don’t even have to worry about the local rebellion. We only have to worry about the three rich foreign cities paying for it.,6,3
GREY WORM, We conquered Asatapor and Yunkai once. We will do it again and execute the Masters.,6,3
TYRION," If the Unsullied march off to reconquer Asatapor and Yunkai, who remain to defend the free people of Meereen?",6,3
GREY WORM," If we do not fight them, how can we stop them?",6,3
MISSANDEI," We cannot. The Masters only speak one language. They spoke it to me for many years. I know it better than my mother tongue. If we want them to hear us, we must speak it back to them. May it be the last thing they ever hear.",6,3
TYRION, You may be right.,6,3
GREY WORM, So we will fight them?,6,3
TYRION, Possibly.,6,3
MISSANDEI, Possibly?,6,3
TYRION, It’s a conversation.,6,3
TYRION," Tell me, can the little birds get a message to the good Masters of Astapor, the wise Masters of Yunkai, the benevolent enslavers of Volantis?",6,3
VARYS," Of course. Man can be fickle, but birds always trust.",6,3
QYBURN," Your eye looks much better, Arthur. How’s your mother’s jaw?",6,3
ARTHUR, Better.,6,3
QYBURN, And your father?,6,3
ARTHUR, No one’s seen him.,6,3
QYBURN, And no one will. That worked out rather nicely.,6,3
LITTLE BIRD, Will Lord Varys ever come back?,6,3
QYBURN, I don’t think so. Do you miss him?,6,3
LITTLE BIRD, He was nice.,6,3
ARTHUR, He called us his little birds. He gave us sweets.,6,3
QYBURN, It’s funny you should mention that. Guess what I happened to find today. Candied plums from Dorne.,6,3
QYBURN," Now remember, if any of your friends like sweets or need help, they can always come to me. All I need in return are whispers.",6,3
QYBURN, No need to be afraid. This is Ser Gregor. He’s friends with all my friends.,6,3
QYBURN, Run along now.,6,3
CERSEI, Varys's little birds?,6,3
QYBURN," Your little birds now, your Grace.",6,3
JAIME, What did you do to him exactly? I haven't been able to get a clear answer.,6,3
QYBURN," Oh, a number of things.",6,3
JAIME," Does he understand what we’re saying? I mean, to the extent that he ever understood complete sentences in the first place.",6,3
QYBURNS, He understands well enough.,6,3
JAIME, So tell him to march into the sept and crush the High Sparrow’s head like a melon.,6,3
CERSEI, The High Sparrow has hundreds of Faith Militant surrounding him. Ser Gregor will can’t face them all. And he won’t have to. He’ll only have to face one.,6,3
JAIME, Has the Faith leveled official charges yet?,6,3
CERSEI, Not yet.,6,3
JAIME, That is one trial by combat I look forward to watching.,6,3
CERSEI (to QYBURN)," Don’t stop at the city. I want little birds in Dorne, in Highgarden, in the North. If someone is planning on making our losses their gains I want to hear it. If someone is laughing at the queen who walk naked through the streets covered in shit, I want to hear. I want to know who they are. I want to where they are.",6,3
CUT TO, RED KEEP - SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER,6,3
MAESTER PYCELLE," As bad as Lord Varys was Varys was, Qyburn is worse. I told them all. I told them. He’s arrogant, dangerous. You don’t get thrown out of the Citadel without good reason. And no one listened to my advice, so here we are.",6,3
MAESTER PYCELLE," And what he's done to Gregor Clegane is an abomination. We never sanctioned this, this experiment. And I for one think it would be in our best interest to have the beast dest --",6,3
KEVAN, Can I help you?,6,3
CERSEI (to LADY OLENNA), Why are you here?,6,3
MACE TYRELL, My mother...,6,3
LADY OLENNA," I was invited, my dear, o help deal with several troublesome issues, such as the queen’s imprisonment.",6,3
CERSEI, Thank you for bringing it up. It’s well past time we addressed the abuses I endured.,6,3
LADY OLENNA, Margaery is the queen. You are not the queen because you’re not married to the king. I do appreciate these things can get a bit confusing in your family.,6,3
KEVAN (to CERSEI & company), This is a Small Council meeting. You have no position on the Small Council.,6,3
JAIME, I’m Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard does have a position on the Small Council.,6,3
CERSEI," Grand Maester Pycelle, would you sanction that statement?",6,3
MAESTER PYCELLE," Well, um...I would say Ser Gerold Hightower had a seat on the Mad King’s council. Of course, that was the Mad King. King Robert saw things differently.",6,3
CERSEI (to KEVAN)," What about Myrcella’s death, Uncle? Do you consider the murder of your own blood a troublesome issue?",6,3
JAIME, The same women who murdered Myrcella have overthrown House Martell and taken control of Dorne. We've got a lot to discuss. All of us together.,6,3
CERSEI," And seeing as you cannot make us leave, we best get on with it.",6,3
KEVAN," No, we cannot make you leave. And you cannot make us stay. Not unless you're gonna have that thing murder us all.",6,3
CUT TO, GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM,6,3
HIGH SPARROW," Oh, your Grace.",6,3
TOMMEN, My mother would like to see her daughter’s final resting place.,6,3
HIGH SPARROW," Oh, I'm, sorry, your Grace. That’s not possible. Not yet.",6,3
TOMMEN, When will it be possible?,6,3
HIGH SPARROW, When she's fully atoned for her sins.,6,3
TOMMEN, You’ve cut off her hair and marched her naked through the streets in front of the whole city. That wasn’t a full atonement?,6,3
HIGH SPARROW," No. She must stand trial before seven septons, so we can learn the true extant of her sins.",6,3
TOMMEN, I want you to let her see Myrcella’s resting place.,6,3
TOMMEN, I am the king.,6,3
HIGH SPARROW, You are.,6,3
TOMMEN, And what does that mean to you?,6,3
HIGH SPARROW, It means a great deal to me. The crown and the faith are the twin pillars of the world. Do you know who told me that? Your mother.,6,3
TOMMEN, My mother who is unclean? My mother who still needs to atone after all you’ve put her through?,6,3
HIGH SPARROW," How do you think the Mother Above first came to us? How did men and women first come to feel the Mother’s presence? It was through their own mothers. There is a great deal of falsehood in Cersei, you know that. But when she speaks of you, the Mother’s love outshines it all. Her love for you is more real than anything else in this world. Because it doesn’t come from this world. But you know that. You’ve felt it. You’ve seen her when she talks to you.",6,3
TOMMEN, Yes.,6,3
HIGH SPARROW, It’s a great gift. One I never had. Envy. One more thing for me to atone for.,6,3
HIGH SPARROW," You Grace, may I? Do you mind? It's my knees.",6,3
TOMMEN, Of course.,6,3
HIGH SPARROW," When your mother made her walk of atonement, she did it to get back to you.",6,3
TOMMEN, I still don’t understand why you want to put her through any more than she's already endured.,6,3
HIGH SPARROW, It’s not what I want. It’s what the gods want. They make their will known to us and it’s up to us to either accept or reject it.,6,3
HIGH SPARROW, Please.,6,3
HIGH SPARROW," If we’re to be just and good, then we accept it, all of us, even kings. A true leader avails himself of the wisest council he can. And no one is wiser than the gods.",6,3
TOMMEN, My grandfather once said something similar. Except for the part about the gods.,6,3
HIGH SPARROW, The gods worked through him whether he knew it or not. As they work through your mother. There’s so much good in all of us. The best we can do is to help each other bring it out.,6,3

ARYA, No one.,6,3

ARYA (V.O.), They may be dead for all a girl knows.,6,3
WAIF, Tell me about The Hound.,6,3
ARYA (V.O.), Also dead.,6,3
ARYA, Arya Stark left him to die. He was on her list.,6,3
ARYA, He was not on her list anymore. She’d taken him off it.,6,3
WAIF, Why? Didn’t she want him dead any longer?,6,3
ARYA, She did and she did not.,6,3
WAIF, She sounds confused.,6,3
ARYA," Yes, she was.",6,3
WAIF, Who else was on Arya Stark’s funny little list?,6,3
ARYA (V.O.)," Cersei Lannister, Gregor Clegane, Walder Frey.",6,3
WAIF, That’s a short list. That can’t be everyone you want to kill.,6,3
WAIF, Are you sure you’re not forgetting someone?,6,3
ARYA, Which name would you like a girl to speak?,6,3
CUT TO, HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - MAIN CHAMBER,6,3

SMALLJON, Your father was a cunt.,6,3
RAMSAY," My beloved father, the Warden --",6,3
SMALLJON," Your father was a cunt and that’s why you killed him. I might’ve done the same to my father, if he hadn’t have done me the favor of dying on his own.",6,3
RAMSAY, My father was poisoned by our enemies.,6,3
SMALLJON, Mmm.,6,3
RAMSAY," Why have you come to Winterfell, Lord Umber?",6,3
SMALLJON," The bastard Jon Snow led an army of wildlings past the Wall. We’re farther north than any of you fuckers. Wildlings come down, we always have to fight them first. I like fighting wildlings, been doing it all my life. But there are too many of them for us to beat back alone.",6,3
RAMSAY, So now you’ve come seeking help?,6,3
SMALLJON," We need to help each other. The colder it gets, the farther South those goat fuckers will roam. Won't take them long to get here.",6,3
LORD KARSTARK, You think a horde of wildlings can take Winterfell?,6,3
SMALLJON," If they get Jon Snow leading them, maybe. He knows this place better than we ever will.",6,3
RAMSAY, Pledge your banners to House Bolton. Swear loyalty to me as Warden of the North and we will fight together to destroy the bastard and all his wildling friends.,6,3
SMALLJON, I’m not kissing your fucking hand.,6,3
RAMSAY, Traditionally a bannerman kneels before his lord.,6,3
SMALLJON, I’m not doing that either.,6,3
RAMSAY, Why would I trust a man who won’t honor tradition?,6,3
SMALLJON, Your father honored tradition. Knelt for Robb Stark. Called him King of the North. Was Robb Stark right to trust your father?,6,3
RAMSAY, Then it appears we're at a bit of an impasse.,6,3
SMALLJON, Fuck kneeling and fuck oaths. I've got a gift for you.,6,3
RAMSAY," A girl, I hope. I prefer redheads.",6,3
SMALLJON," A girl, aye. A wild one.",6,3
RAMSAY, I like them wild.,6,3
SMALLJON," And the boy, nice and young. The way Karstark likes them.",6,3

JON SNOW, Neither was killing me.,6,3
OTHELL YARWICK, My mother's still living at White Harbor. Could you write her? Tell her I died fighting the wildings.,6,3
ALLISER THRONE," I had a choice, Lord Commander. Betray you or betray the Night’s Watch. You brought an army of wildlings into our lands. An army of muderers and raiders. If I had to do it all over knowing where I’d end up, I pray I’d make the right choice again.",6,3
JON SNOW," I’m sure you would, Ser Alliser.",6,3
ALLISER THRONE," I fought, I lost. Now I rest. But you, Lord Snow, you’ll be fighting their battles forever.",6,3
DOLOROUS EDD, We should burn the bodies.,6,3
JON SNOW, You should.,6,3
DOLOROUS EDD, What do you want me to do with this?,6,3
JON SNOW, Wear it. Burn it. Whatever you want. You have Castle Black.,6,3
JON SNOW, My watch is ended.,6,3
DOLOROUS EDD, Where you gonna go?,6,4
JON SNOW, South.,6,4
DOLOROUS EDD, What are you gonna do?,6,4
JON SNOW, Get warm.,6,4
DOLOROUS EDD, I was with you at Hardhome. We saw what’s out there. We know it’s coming here. How can you leave us now?,6,4
JON SNOW, I did everything I could. You know that.,6,4

JON SNOW, We never should have left Winterfell.,6,4
SANSA," Don’t you wish we could go back to the day we left? I want to scream at myself, “Don’t go, you idiot.”",6,4
JON SNOW, How could we know?,6,4
SANSA, I spent a lot of time thinking about what as ass I was to you. I wish I could change everything.,6,4
JON SNOW, We were children.,6,4
SANSA," I was awful, just admit it.",6,4
JON SNOW, You were occasionally awful. I’m sure I can’t have been great fun. Always sulking in the corner while the rest of you played.,6,4
SANSA, Can you forgive me?,6,4
JON SNOW, There’s nothing to forgive.,6,4
SANSA, Forgive me.,6,4
JON SNOW," All right. All right, I forgive you.",6,4

SANSA, Where will you go?,6,4
JON SNOW," Where will we go? If I don’t watch over you, Father’s ghost will come back and murder me.",6,4
SANSA, Where will we go?,6,4
JON SNOW," I can’t stay here, not after what happened.",6,4
SANSA, There’s only one place we can go. Home.,6,4
JON SNOW, Should we tell the Boltons to pack up and leave?,6,4
SANSA, We’ll take it back from them.,6,4
JON SNOW, I don’t have an army.,6,4
SANSA, How many wildlings did you save?,6,4
JON SNOW, They didn’t come here to serve me.,6,4
SANSA, They owe you their lives.,6,4
SANSA, You think they’ll be safe here if Roose Bolton remains Warden of the North?,6,4
JON SNOW, Sansa.,6,4
SANSA," Winterfell is our home. It’s ours and Arya’s and Bran’s and Rickon’s. Wherever they are, it belongs to our family. We have to fight for it.",6,4
JON SNOW, I’m tired of fighting.,6,4
JON SNOW, It’s all I’ve done since I left home. I’ve killed brothers of the Night’s Watch. I’ve killed wildlings. I’ve killed men that I admire. I hanged a boy younger than Bran. I fought and I lost.,6,4

LITTLEFINGER," On our way to the Fingers, we were set upon by a large force of Bolton men. Seemed to know exactly when we were traveling and exactly whom we were transporting.",6,4
YOHN ROYCE, Do you take me for a fool?,6,4
LITTLEFINGER," Tell me, Lord Royce, how many people knew of my travel plans with Sansa Stark? I shared my intentions with you and no one else.",6,4
YOHN ROYCE," Slander a man in his own home, you might find yourself crossing swords with him.",6,4
LITTLEFINGER, Your home is the Vale. The Lord of the Vale stands before us. And only his judgment concerns me.,6,4
ROBIN, Shall we throw him through the Moon Door?,6,4
YOHN ROYCE," My lord. My lord, I have always been faithful to House Arryn. To your father, to your mother, and now to you.",6,4
ROBIN," Do you believe him, Uncle Petyr?",6,4
LITTLEFINGER," Lord Royce has served the Vale well. He;s enjoyed a distinguished military career. If we could trust his absolute loyalty, he would make a capable commander in the wars to come.",6,4
YOHN ROYCE," You can trust my absolute loyalty, my lord.",6,4
LITTLEFINGER, I think he deserves one more chance. What do you say?,6,4
ROBIN, Fine.,6,4
LITTLEFINGER (to ROBIN)," I bring good news. My friends in the North tell me Sansa has escaped Winterfell. I expect she’s headed to Castle Black where her brother serves as Lord Commander. But she won’t be safe there, not with the Boltons after her.",6,4
ROBIN, She’s my cousin. We should help her.,6,4
LITTLEFINGER, That was my instinct as well.,6,4
LITTLEFINGER, Our lord has spoken. Gather the Knights of the Vale. The time has come to join the fray.,6,4
GREY WORM, You invite the enemy into our city?,6,4
TYRION," I did. As a clever man once told me, “We make peace with our enemies, not our friends.”",6,4
GREY WORM, I don’t make peace with the queen’s enemies. I kill the queen’s enemies.,6,4
TYRION," Yes, that’s the military approach. And how has that worked here in Meereen? I represent the diplomatic approach.",6,4
MISSANDEI, Our queen tried to make peace with the Masters and they tried to murder her.,6,4
MISSANDEI, How many days were you a slave?,6,4
TYRION, Long enough to know.,6,4
MISSANDEI, Not long enough to understand.,6,4
CUT TO, MEEREEN - COUNCIL CHAMBER,6,4
YEZZAN, I bought this dwarf for a single gold honor. And somehow you’ve risen to the top of the Great Pyramid of Meereen. It’s most impressive.,6,4
TYRION, And now you speak for the Good Masters of Astapor.Here’s to reversals of fortune.,6,4
RAZDAL, We came here to meet the queen and instead we’re greeted by a dwarf and a eunuch.,6,4
TYRION," Let’s make this simple, shall we? Tell me what you want.",6,4
BELICHO, We want you to leave Slaver’s Bay. Take your dragons and your mercenaries and go.,6,4
TYRION, Queen Daenerys won’t stay in Meereen forever. Her path takes her westward.,6,4
RAZDAL," When we last met, I offered her ships so she could return to Westeros where she belongs. She refused them.",6,4
MISSANDEI," She refused them because hundreds of thousands of men, women, and children still lived in chains.",6,4
RAZDAL, As they have since the dawn of time.,6,4
GREY WORM, Not anymore.,6,4
YEZZAN, You think you’re a free man now? You still follow orders. Just because your master has silver hair and tits doesn’t mean she’s not a master.,6,4
TYRION," Friends, friends, friends, please.",6,4
TYRION, There have always been those with wealth and power and those with nothing. That is the way of the world. I’m not here to change the way of the world.,6,4
YEZZAN, Slavery is the way of our world.,6,4
TYRION, You don’t need slaves to make money. There haven’t been slaves in Westeros for hundreds of years and I grew up richer than any of you. But our queen recognizes that she erred by abolishing slavery without providing a new system to replace it. So here is the queen’s proposal. Slavery will never return to Meereen but she will give the other cities of Slaver’s Bay time to adjust to the new order.,6,4
YEZZAN, What does that mean?,6,4
TYRION," Instead of abolishing slavery overnight, we will give you seven years to end the practice.",6,4
TYRION," Slaveholders will be compensated for their losses, of course, at fair prices. In exchange, you will cut off your support for the Sons of the Harpy.",6,4
YEZZAN, We do not support the Sons of the Harpy.,6,4
TYRION," Fine, fine, but you will cut it off all the same. I do hope you accept, my friends. You will not receive a better offer.",6,4
TYRION, Let us sail on the tide of freedom instead of being drowned by it. And as a parting gift to our honored guests…,6,4
TYRION, Give freedom a chance. See if it doesn’t taste every bit as good as what came before.,6,4
CUT TO, MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER,6,4
TYRION (speaking Valyrian), My friends! Large sorry...you wait so fat time.,6,4
MISSANDEI (to TYRION), Perhaps I should translate for you.,6,4
MAN #1, We speak the Common Tongue.,6,4
TYRION, Excellent.,6,4
MAN #2, You met with the slavers today.,6,4
TYRION, I did.,6,4
MAN #1, Our brothers and sister died fighting these scum. Now you invite them to our city and drink wine with them.,6,4
TYRION, I imagine this room was built so the rulers could intimidate the ruled.,6,4
TYRION, But I am not your ruler. I’m not the Breaker of Chains. I’m not the Unburnt. And I am certainly not the Mother of Dragons.,6,4
MAN #1, You are a stranger here. So why do you represent Meereen in these talks with our enemies?,6,4
TYRION, Because our queen chose me as her advisor. Until she returns from her travels --,6,4
MAN #2, When does she return?,6,4
TYRION, Soon. You have my word.,6,4
MAN #1, We don’t know you. We don’t trust you. We know Torgo Nudho. We fight with him against the Masters. We trust him.,6,4
TYRION," And that is exactly why Grey Worm took part in these negotiations. As commander of the Unsullied, he knows hot to defeat the slavers and he knows when it is time to make peace.",6,4
MAN #2, You have made peace with the slavers?,6,4
TYRION, We offered terms.,6,4
MAN #1 (speaking Valyrian)," And you, Grey Worm? You want to drink wine with these men? The men who tore us from our mothers’ arms and sold us at auction like cattle?",6,4
GREY WORM (speaking Valyrian)," I am a soldier, not a politician. But if there is a chance for peace -- a just peace -- we should take it.",6,4
MAN #2 (speaking Valyrian)," Missandei, you know what these men are. How can you trust them?",6,4
MISSANDEI (speaking Valyrian), I do not trust them. I will never trust them.,6,4
MISSANDEI (speaking Valyrian)," But as a wise man once said, “We make peace with our enemies, not our friends.”",6,4
CUT TO, MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE,6,4
GREY WORM, Do not use me for your lies.,6,4
TYRION, Those men respect you.,6,4
GREY WORM, They respect me because they know who I am. They know I am loyal.,6,4
TYRION, As do I.,6,4
GREY WORM," I am loyal to my queen, not you. If you betray her work, you are my enemy.",6,4
TYRION, I am not betraying her work. I am trying to save her city.,6,4
MISSANDEI, You promised the slavers they could keep slavery.,6,4
TYRION, For a short time.,6,4
MISSANDEI, Seven years is not a short time for a slave.,6,4
TYRION, You’re right. Slavery is a horror that should be ended at once. War is a horror that should be ended at once. I can’t do both today.,6,4
GREY WORM, You are wrong to trust these men.,6,4
TYRION, I don’t trust the Masters. I trust their self-interest. They’re trustworthy if they’re convinced that working with me is in their self-interest.,6,4
GREY WORM, You don’t know them. You don’t understand them. We are not human in their eyes. They look at me and see a weapon. They look at her and see a whore.,6,4
TYRION, They look at me and they see a misshapen little beast. Their contempt is their weakness. They’ll underestimate us every time and we will use that to our advantage.,6,4
GREY WORM, You will not use them. They will use you. That is what they do.,6,4
DAARIO, You all right? Why don’t you sit and catch your breath?,6,4
JORAH, I’m fine.,6,4
DAARIO," I don’t think you could ride the dragon. 20 years ago, maybe.",6,4
JORAH, What?,6,4
DAARIO," Our queen. She’s wild, you know. Don’t let her size fool you. It’s hard enough for me and I’m a young man. You, I don’t think your heart could take it.",6,4
DAARIO, Must make you angry that our queen chose me.,6,4
JORAH, Makes me sad. You’ll disappoint her before long. She’ll move on.,6,4
DAARIO, We’ll all disappoint her before long.,6,4
JORAH, We need each other right now. After we’re done needing each other --,6,4
DAARIO," Oh, I don’t want to fight you, Jorah the Andal. What do I have to gain? If I win, I’m the shit who killed an old man. If I lose, I’m the shit who was killed by an old man.",6,4
JORAH," You didn’t get much discipline as a child, did you?",6,4
DAARIO, None.,6,4
JORAH," The road running through the Horse Gate, they call that the godsway.",6,4
JORAH," Eastern Market, Western Market. When Khal Drogo died, she was supposed to come here and join the Dosh Khaleen, the widows of the dead khals. That’s where they would have taken her, the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen.",6,4
DAARIO, What are you doing?,6,4
JORAH, It’s forbidden to carry weapons in the sacred city.,6,4
DAARIO, Isn’t it forbidden to sneak into their city and steal their khaleesi?,6,4
JORAH," If they spot us and we’re unarmed, we’ll say we’re traders heading for the Western Market. But if they see weapons…",6,4
DAARIO, You’re asking a dog to hand over his teeth.,6,4
JORAH," There’s 100,000 of them down there. We can’t fight our way out. We wait till dark, and then we’ll find her.",6,4
DARRIO, Uh…,6,4
DAARIO, I’m very attached to this knife.,6,4
JORAH, Don’t worry. it didn’t touch you.,6,4
DAARIO, You know what happens?,6,4
JORAH, I know what happens.,6,4
DAARIO, I’ll do it myself.,6,4
CUT TO, VAES DOTHRAK - NIGHT,6,4
DAARIO, I should have been born a Dothraki.,6,4
JORAH, Come on.,6,4
JORAH, My friends...We wandered off from the Western Market and got lost. Could you show us the way back?,6,4
DOTHRAKI #1, What do you sell?,6,4
JORAH," Wine. Come down to my stall tomorrow, I’ll give you a cask of the Arbor’s finest.",6,4
DOTHRAKI #1, You’re not merchants.,6,4
DOTHRAKI #1, Get the others.,6,4
DAARIO," Told you, I’m very attached to this knife.",6,4
DAARIO, You all right?,6,4
JORAH," If they find a body with a stab wound, the whole city will be looking for us.",6,4
DAARIO, Huh.,6,4
CUT TO, VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN,6,4
LEADER, Some of them don’t think Dothraki should breed with foreigners. They are stupid old women. They don’t realize that we have always diluted our blood. This one is Lhazareen. Her Khal found her hiding in a well after he burned her village. How old were you?,6,4
LHAZAREEN WOMAN, Twelve.,6,4
LEADER," A year later, she bore her Khal a daughter. How did he show his happiness?",6,4
LHAZAREEN WOMAN, He broke my ribs.,6,4
LEADER," We are not queens here, but the khals depend on us for our wisdom. Our lives have meaning.",6,4
DAENERYS, That is more than most have.,6,4
LEADER," When the khals meet for the Khalar Vezhven tomorrow night, I hope they let you live out your days with us. The other possibilities are not so pleasant.",6,4
DAENERYS, I need to make water.,6,4
LEADER, You can’t run from Dothraki. You know this.,6,4
DAENERYS, I will never run from Dothraki.,6,4
LEADER (to LHAZAREEN WOMAN)," Go, show her.",6,4
DAENERYS, I needed fresh air. The old women stink.,6,4
LHAZAREEN WOMAN, They do stink.,6,4
DAENERYS, You must have been very young when your Khal died.,6,4
LHAZAREEN WOMAN, Sixteen.,6,4
DAENERYS, Too bad he didn’t die sooner.,6,4
LHAZAREEN WOMAN," Yes, too bad.",6,4
LHAZAREEN WOMAN, Is it true you have three dragons?,6,4
DAENERYS, Mm-hmm.,6,4
LHAZAREEN WOMAN, And they breathe fire?,6,4
DAENERYS, They do. Would you like to see them one day?,6,4
LHAZAREEN WOMAN," I am Dosh Khaleen. I can never leave Vaes Dothrak, until I rise as smoke from the pyre on the day I die.",6,4
DAENERYS," No, don’t hurt her.",6,4
DAARIO, She’ll give us away.,6,4
JORAH, We have to go now.,6,4
DAENERYS, We will never get out of Vaes Dothrak alive.,6,4
JORAH, All we can do is try.,6,4
DAENERYS, No. We can do more than that. And you’re going to help me.,6,4
DAENERYS (speaking Dothraki)," And you...Have faith in me, Khaleesi. Do not betray me.",6,4
HIGH SPARROW," If I were to let you leave right now, where would you go? What would you seek out?",6,4
MARGAERY," I’d go to my brother, my husband, my family.",6,4
HIGH SPARROW," Of course, but for you, that means seeking out money, finery, power. Seeking out your family means seeking out sin. I’m not maligning you. I sought those things out, too. To the exclusion of all else. My father was a cobbler. He died with I was young and I took over his shop. He was a simple man and he made simple shoes. But I found that the more work I put into my shoes, the more people wanted them. Fine leather, ornamentation, detailing, and time. Time most of all. Dozens of hours spent on a single pair.",6,4
MARGAERY, Quality takes time.,6,4
HIGH SPARROW," Yes. I imagine you’ve worn a year of someone’s life on your back. The highborn liked to cover their feet with my time and they paid well for the privilege. I used their money to buy a taste of their lives for myself. Each time I indulged, I felt myself ascending to something better.",6,4
MARGAERY," And one day you walked through a graveyard and realized it was all for nothing and set out on the path to righteousness. Book of the Stranger, verse 25.",6,4
HIGH SPARROW, You know The Seven-Pointed Star.,6,4
MARGAERY, Septa Unella reads it to me. At me.,6,4
HIGH SPARROW," Yes, yes, she does enjoy reading at people. You’re close. But it wasn’t a graveyard. It was a feast. I bought old fine wine and young pretty girls and invited my friends to come share it all. We passed around the wine, passed around the women, and soon we fell into a stupor. I woke before dawn. I could barely stand. Everyone else was asleep on the couches or on the floor, lying in heaps next to their fine clothes. The truth of their bodies laid bare. I could smell them beneath the incense and the perfume and the fine food that had already started to turn. And I saw it with perfect clarity. I saw what my sins were. The gold I had, the wine I drank, the women I used, my ceaseless struggle to maintain my position. It was all part of a story. A story I was telling myself about who I was. A collection of lies that would disappear in the light. The people I was trying to climb away from, the beggars in the street, the poor, they were closer to the truth than I ever was.",6,4
MARGAERY, So what did you do?,6,4
HIGH SPARROW, I left to go and find them. I didn’t even put on my shoes. I walked out the door and never went back.,6,4
HIGH SPARROW," Come, let’s go and see him.",6,4
MARGAERY, Who?,6,4
HIGH SPARROW, Your brother.,6,4
CUT TO, GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR – LORAS’ CELL,6,4
MARGAERY, Loras. Loras.,6,4
MARGAERY, Listen to me. You need to stay strong.,6,4
LORAS, I can’t stay strong. I never was strong.,6,4
MARGAERY," You are strong. You are the future of our house, the future of our family.",6,4
LORAS, I don’t care about that.,6,4
MARGAERY, Shh. Have you -- have you told them that? That you don’t care?,6,4
LORAS, I just want it to stop. Help me.,6,4
MARGAERY," They want me to help you. They want me told help tear you down. That’s why he’s letting me see you, I know it is. And if either of us give in to what they want, then they win.",6,4
LORAS, Let them win. Just make it stop. Please.,6,4
MARGAERY, All right.,6,4
CUT TO, RED KEEP – TOMMEN'S CHAMBER,6,4
MAESTER PYCELLE," And now, how to avert disaster with our current predicament. This High Sparrow. I have dealt with fanatics of every description, Your Grace. Not setting them off, that’s the most important thing. You are beset with enemies both within and without.",6,4
CERSEI, What are you doing here?,6,4
MAESTER PYCELLE, I am advising the king on our current predicament.,6,4
CERSEi, Leave.,6,4
MAESTER PYCELL, I am a member of the Small Council. The king’s small --,6,4
CERSEI, Is this a Small Council meeting?,6,4
MAESTER PYCELL, Obviously not. I’m here to lend my wisdom and my support.,6,4
TOMMEN," Thank you for your counsel, Grand Maester. That will be all for now.",6,4
MAESTER PYCELL, Your Grace.,6,4
CERSEI," Since I’ve missed the past several Small Coucil meetings, I wanted to speak to you about a few things.",6,4
TOMMEN, I’ve been thinking about the High Sparrow.,6,4
CERSEI," As have we all, unfortunately.",6,4
TOMMEN, We need to be careful in dealing with such a man. To prevent things from escalating any further. We have to be careful not to antagonize him. He has Margaery. We can’t put her at risk. He’s dangerous.,6,4
CERSEI, Look at me. What did they do to me? To the king’s own mother?,6,4
CERSEI, It’s all right. It's done. It’s in the past. And of course Margaery’s safety is paramount.,6,4
TOMMEN," You don’t like Margaery, do you?",6,4
CERSEI," Whether I like her or not is completely unimportant. Margaery is the queen. Queens must command respect. Kings even more so. Not just for their own sake, but for everyone’s. The High Sparrow has no respect for kings or queens. No respect for anything in this world. He has no use for the things of this world. He want to knock them down and replace them with what? With fantasies. With beggars in the street. With nothing.",6,4
TOMMEN, Mother...there’s something I want to tell you. Something the High Sparrow told me.,6,4
CERSEI, You’ve spoken with him?,6,4
TOMMEN, I promised him I wouldn’t tell anyone. If he found out I told --,6,4
CERSEI," It would be a breach of confidence which he would not take lightly, given his constant prattling about the truth. I am your mother. You can always trust me.",6,4
CUT TO, RED KEEP – SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER,6,4
CERSEI, The Small Council meeting has been postponed on the king’s orders.,6,4
LADY OLENNA, I would have thought we were perfectly clear the first time. You’re not welcome.,6,4
CERSEI, You once spoke of your respect for our father because he understood the necessity of working with one’s rivals.,6,4
LADY OLENNA," My dear, you have been stripped of your dignity and authority, publicly shamed, and confined to the Red Keep. What’s left to work with?",6,4
JAIME, Cersei is the mother of the king. She has the king’s ear and his trust. And the king has been speaking regularly with the High Sparrow about Queen Margaery and Ser Loras.,6,4
CERSEI," The High Sparrow seized power knowing full well we'd bicker amongst ourselves instead of seizing it back. Here we are. Well done to us. Now the future of the Seven Kingdoms rest in his dirty, peasant hands. In a few days, he’ll have a trial for me. But before that, Queen Margaery will make her walk of atonement. Yes, Margaery will repent her sins before the good people of the city.",6,4
LADY OLENNA," Oh, no. That cannot happen. That will not happen.",6,4
CERSEi, I agree.,6,4
JAIME (to KEVAN)," You’ve got the second largest army in Westeros. You'll bring them into the city, stop queen Margaery’s humiliation before it starts, and take her back into Crown custody.",6,4
KEVAN, The king has ordered me to take no action against the High Sparrow or the Faith Militant out of fear for the queen’s safety.,6,4
JAIME," You’ll take no action at all. When the Tyrell armies come, you will stand down. Are you expressly forbidden from standing down?",6,4
KEVAN," No, but if the king should call on me --",6,4
JAIME," The whole thing will be over before anyone can call on you to do anything. When the High Sparrow is in custody or dead, preferably, and Margaery's back at Tommen’s side, do you think the king will be angry at the outcome?",6,4
CERSEI, You hate these fanatics as much as we do. You hate what they’ve done to your son. Do you want Lancel back or have you given him up for good?,6,4
KEVAN, Of course I want him back.,6,4
CERSEI, Then stand aside and let the people that took him from you be destroyed.,6,4
KEVAN," If it doesn’t go as planned, the Sparrows have many friends in the city. We’ll have civil war. Many will die.",6,4
LADY OLENNA, Many will die no matter what we do. Better them than us.,6,4
CUT TO, PYKE CASTLE – GREAT HALL,6,4
YARA," They told me you were home and I didn’t believe it. “Theon Greyjoy?” I said. “He’s dead. He’s been dead a long time."" He let you go?",6,4
THEON, I escaped.,6,4
YARA, I can’t hear you.,6,4
THEON, I escaped.,6,4
YARA, Look at me. Look at me! Men died trying to rescue you. Good men. My men.,6,4
THEON, I’m sorry.,6,4
YARA," You were my brother. You’re a spoiled little cunt, but you were my brother and I risked everything for you and you betrayed me.",6,4
THEON, I know. I know and I’m sorry.,6,4
YARA, Stop saying that.,6,4
THEON, He broke me. He broke me into a thousand pieces.,6,4
YARA, I know.,6,4
THEON, You don’t know.,6,4
YARA, He send us one of those pieces. That’s why I came for you.,6,4
YARA, Why did you come here?,6,4
THEON, Where else could I go?,6,4
YARA, You heard father was dead and thought you’d claim the crown?,6,4
THEON," No, no. I only heard he died after we docked.",6,4
YARA, You happen to show up on Pyke right before the Kingsmoot?,6,4
THEON, I didn’t know.,6,4
YARA, You think any Ironborn wants you to be king? After what you’ve done?,6,4
THEON, I don’t want to be king.,6,4
YARA, What do you want?,6,4
THEON, I should’ve listened to you. You’re the only one --,6,4
YARA, That doesn’t matter anymore. Stop crying. Look at me. Tell me what you want.,6,4
THEON, You should rule the Iron Islands. Let me help you.,6,4
RAMSAY, They've cleaned you up nicely. You know who I am?,6,4
OSHA, A lord?,6,4
RAMSAY, Yes. A lord. You’ve seen my banners?,6,4
OSHA, The flayed man.,6,4
RAMSAY, Does that worry you at all?,6,4
OSHA, You eat them after?,6,4
RAMSAY, No.,6,4
OSHA, Then I’ve seen worse.,6,4
RAMSAY, You served the Starks?,6,4
OSHA," Aye. They put me in chains and put a sword at my throat, so I’ve served them.",6,4
RAMSAY," The Starks have been gone for a long time, but you kept protecting Rickon.",6,4
OSHA," He'd fetch a good price to the right buyer. I served his family a long time. Didn’t get no wages. Way I see it, I’m owed.",6,4
RAMSAY," Be that as it may, Rickon's not yours to sell anymore. He’s mine. So what use could I possibly have for you?",6,4
OSHA, I can give you what you want.,6,4
RAMSAY, Are you sure you know what that is?,6,4
OSHA," Same thing men always want. And when they really want it, they give it a bath first.",6,4
RAMSAY, You’re a good talker.,6,4
RAMSAY, I like that.,6,4
RAMSAY, You’re a much better talker than Theon Greyjoy.,6,4
OSHA, That so?,6,4
RAMSAY, I had to work hard to get him talking. But he talked. They all do.,6,4
RAMSAY," He told me everything. All about the Stark boys. Who helped them escape, and how she did it.",6,4
MAN, Open the gate!,6,4
CUT TO, CASTLE BLACK – MESS HALL,6,4
DOLOROUS EDD (to SANSA), Sorry about the food. It’s not what we’re known for.,6,4
SANSA, That’s all right. There are more important things.,6,4
MAN," A letter for you, Lord Commander.",6,4
JON SNOW, I’m not Lord Commander anymore.,6,4
JON SNOW," ""To the traitor and bastard Jon Snow. You allowed thousands of wildlings past the Wall. You have betrayed your own kind. You have betrayed the North. Winterfell is mine, bastard. Come and see. Your brother Rickon is in my dungeon.",6,4
JON SNOW," His direwolf's skin is on my floor. Come and see. I want my bride back. Send her to me, bastard, and I will not trouble you or your wildling lovers. Keep her from me and I will ride north and slaughter every wildling man, woman, and babe living under your protection. You will watch as I skin them living. You --",6,4
SANSA, Go on.,6,4
JON SNOW, It's just more of the same.,6,4
SANSA," ""You will watch as my soldiers take turns raping your sister. You will watch as my dogs your wild little brother. Then I will spoon your eyes from their sockets and let my dogs do the rest. Come and see. Ramsay Bolton, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North.",6,4
JON SNOW, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North.,6,4
SANSA, His father's dead. Ramsay killed him. And now he has Rickon.,6,4
JON SNOW, We don’t know that.,6,4
SANSA," Yes, we do.",6,4
TORMUND, How many men does he have in his army?,6,4
SANSA," I heard him say 5,000 once when he was talking about Stannis’s attack.",6,4
JON SNOW (to TORMUND), How many do you have?,6,4
TORMUND," That can march and fight? 2,000. The rest are children and old people.",6,4
SANSA (to JON SNOW), You're the son of the last true Warden of the North. Northern families are loyal. They’ll fight for you if you ask.,6,4
SANSA, A monster has taken our home and our brother. We have to go back to Winterfell and save them both.,6,4
KHAL MORO, It is forbidden to spill blood in the sacred city. It is forbidden to carry weapons in the sacred city.,6,4
KHAL #1, So we don’t spill blood.,6,4
KHAL MORO, Well… there’s always a little blood.,6,4
KHAL #1, Someone crushed his head with a rock.,6,4
KHAL MORO, Aggo belonged to my khalaser. He served me well. He got his head smashed in by a rock. Fuck Aggo.,6,4
KHAL MORO, Bring in Drogo’s widow.,6,4
KHAL #2, Who cares about her? She’s a midget.,6,4
KHAL #1, I like her.,6,4
KHAL #2, She’s paler than milk.,6,4
KHAL #3, I’d like to know what a khaleesi tastes like.,6,4
KHAL #1, Good. You can suck my dick.,6,4
KHAL MORO, She belongs with the Dosh Khaleen.,6,4
KHAL #4," The Wise Masters of Yunkai want her. They’re offering ten thousand horses In exchange. What's worth more, one pink little girl or ten thousand horses?",6,4
KHAL MORO, Fuck the Wise Masters in their perfumed asses. I’ll take their horses for myself.,6,4
DAENERYS, Don’t you want to know what I think?,6,4
KHAL MORO, You’d rather be sold to slavery? Or maybe you’d like to show Rhalko here what you taste like?,6,4
DAENERYS, No. I don’t want either of those things.,6,4
KHAL MORO," We don’t care what you want. This is the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen. You have no voice here, unless you are Dosh Khaleen. Which you are not, until we decide you are.",6,4
DAENERYS, I know where I am. I have been here before. This is where the Dosh Khaleen pronounced my child the Stallion Who Mounts the World.,6,4
KHAL MORO," And what happened? You trusted a sorceress, like a fool. Your baby is dead because of you. And so is Khal Drogo.",6,4
DAENERYS, This is where Drogo promised to take his khalasar west to where the world ends. To ride wooden horses across the Black Salt Sea as no khal has done before. He promised to kill the men in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses. He swore to me before the Mother of Mountains.,6,4
KHAL MORO, And you were dumb enough to believe him?,6,4
DAENERYS," And here, now, what great matters do the Great Khals discuss? Which little villages you’ll raid, how many girls you’ll get to fuck, how many horses you’ll demand in tribute. You are small men. None of you are fit to lead the Dothraki. But I am. So I will.",6,4
KHAL MORO, All right. No Dosh Khaleen for you. Instead we’ll take turns fucking you. And then we’ll let our bloodriders fuck you.,6,4
KHAL MORO," And If there’s anything left of you, we’ll give our horses a turn. You crazy cunt. Did you really think we would serve you?",6,4
DAENERYS, You’re not going to serve. You’re going to die.,6,4
SANSA, Yes?,6,5
MAN," For you, my lady.",6,5
SANSA, How far is Mole’s Town?,6,5
CUT TO, MOLE’S TOWN - SHACK,6,5
LITTLEFINGER," Sansa. Lady Brienne. When I heard you had escaped WInterfell, I feared the worst. You have no idea how happy I am to see you unharmed.",6,5
SANSA, Unharmed? What are you doing here?,6,5
LITTLEFINGER, I rode north with the Knights of the Vale to come to your aid. They’re encamped at Moat Cailin as we speak.,6,5
SANSA," To come to my aid? Did you know about Ramsay? If you didn’t know, you’re an idiot. If you did know, you’re my enemy.",6,5
SANSA," Would you like to hear about our wedding night? He never hurt my face. He needed my face, the face of Ned Stark’s daughter. But the rest of me, he did what he liked with the rest of me as long as I could still give him an heir. What do you think he did?",6,5
LITTLEFINGER, I can’t begin to contemplate --,6,5
SANSA, What do you think he did to me?,6,5
BRIENNE, Lady Sansa asked you a question.,6,5
LITTLEFINGER, He beat you.,6,5
SANSA," Yes, he enjoyed that. What else do you think he did?",6,5
LITTLEFINGER," Sansa, I --",6,5
SANSA, What else?,6,5
LITTLEFINGER, Did he cut you?,6,5
SANSA, Maybe you did know about Ramsay all along.,6,5
LITTLEFINGER, I didn’t know.,6,5
SANSA, I thought you knew everyone’s secrets.,6,5
LITTLEFINGER," I made a mistake, a horrible mistake. I underestimated a stranger.",6,5
SANSA," The other things he did, ladies aren’t supposed to talk about those things, but I imagine brothel keepers talk about them all the time. I can still feel it. I don’t mean in my tender heart it still pains me so. I can still feel what he did in my body standing here right now.",6,5
LITTLEFINGER, I’m so sorry.,6,5
SANSA, You said you would protect me.,6,5
LITTLEFINGER, And I will. You must believe me when I tell you that I will.,6,5
SANSA, I don’t believe you anymore. I don’t need you anymore. You can’t protect me. You won’t even be able to protect yourself if I tell Brienne to cut you down. And why shouldn’t I?,6,5
LITTLEFINGER," Do you want me to beg for my life? If that’s what you want, I will. Whatever you ask that is in my power, I will do.",6,5
SANSA, What if I want you to die here and now?,6,5
LITTLEFINGER, Then I will die.,6,5
SANSA, You freed me from the monsters who murdered my family and you gave me to other monsters who murdered my family. Go back to Moat Cailin. My brother and I will take back the North on our own. I never want to see you again.,6,5
LITTLEFINGER, I would do anything to undo what’s been done to you. I know that I can’t. Will you allow me to say one more thing before I go? Your great-uncle Brynden the Blackfish has gathered what remains of the Tully forces and retaken Riverrun. You might consider seeking him out. The time may come when you need an army loyal to you.,6,5
SANSA, I have an army.,6,5
LITTLEFINGER, Your brother’s army.,6,5
LITTLEFINGER, Half-brother.,6,5
WAIF, You’re not ready. You should go home before it’s too late.,6,5
WAIF," You’ll never be one of us, Lady Stark.",6,5
JAQEN, She has a point.,6,5
JAQEN, None of the first Faceless Men were born to lords and ladies. They began as slaves in the mines of Valyria.,6,5
ARYA, Who was the first?,6,5
JAQEN," He was no one. The Many-Faced God taught him how to shed his face and how to give the gift. The man taught others in exchange for their service. Many served, many more gifts were given. Soon all the masters and overseers were gone and the Faceless Men fled.",6,5
ARYA, Where did they go?,6,5
JAQEN," Here. They founded the Free City of Braavos and built this house. These were the faces they wore in life when they were not wearing others. The first Faceless Men. And now a girl is one of them, if a girl desires.",6,5
ARYA, A girl has no desires.,6,5
ARYA, Who?,6,5
JAQEN," An actress who calls herself Lady Crane. She performs at the theater in Sheelba Square. A girl has been given a second chance. There will not be a third. One way or another, a face will be added to the hall.",6,5
CUT TO, BRAAVOS - SHEELBA SQUARE,6,5
IZEMBARO, Ahh!,6,5
IZEMBARO," Oh, murdered by a boar. The great big hairy whore. He dug in his tusks and dug out my guts and soon I am no more.",6,5
CLARENZO," Oh, come, Father, in bed you must lie. I love you, Father. Please don’t die.",6,5
IZEMBARO," Shut up, you swine! Cersei, more wine.",6,5
LADYC RANE," I feel the winds of winter as they lick across the land. And our son alone on that cold, cold throne without a guiding hand. Who will teach him strength? Who will teach him grace? To whom will he turn when it’s time to learn to look darkness in the face?",6,5
IZEMBARO, Ned stark will do fine. Now bring me more wine.,6,5
CAMELLO," Ooh! Ooh, what’s happened here, then?",6,5
BOBONO," He brought you here, Ned Stark, ‘cause you’re the brightest fellow in the land. You should be king of us all and I should be your Hand.",6,5
CAMELLO, We men of the North are right good hands at keeping people lawful.,6,5
CAMELLO," I’d ask him for permission, but he smells too bloody awful.",6,5
IZEMBARO," I die! I die! And here I now must lie. Oh, woe. Oh, no. Oh, I am about to go.",6,5
LADY CRANE, Will you stay on as Joffrey’s Hand?,6,5
CAMELLO, The Iron Throne’s what I demand.,6,5
LADY CRANE, You cannot.,6,5
CAMELLO, I can.,6,5
LADY CRANE, You will not.,6,5
CAMELLO, I will.,6,5
LADY CRANE, You dare not.,6,5
CAMELLO, I dare yes.,6,5
LADY CRANE, The line of succession.,6,5
CAMELLO, What’s that mean?,6,5
LADY CRANE, The proper progression.,6,5
CAMELLO, What’s that mean?,6,5
LADY CRANE, The lawful ascension.,6,5
CAMELLO, What’s that mean?,6,5
CAMELLO," So move along, give me my chair and there won’t be no more trouble.",6,5
CAMELLO, But we had a deal all done and dusted.,6,5
CAMELLO, I’m starting to think you can’t be trusted.,6,5
BIANCA, Save my father.,6,5
LADY CRANE, Truly you should. Killing the man will do you no good.,6,5
BIANCA," Save him, please.",6,5
LADY CRANE, Show him mercy. Show the people what a good king should be.,6,5
CLARENZO," Good people, you may all relax. My father’s friend shall be spared the —",6,5
BIANCA," Father! No! Oh, father.",6,5
BOBONO," Worry not! All is well. I have here a decree from my father Tywin Lannister, the richest man you’ll see. He proclaims me Hand of the King. The position’s mine for life. And he’s give me permission to take Sansa as my wife.",6,5
BOBONO, You’ll learn that what I lack in height I make up for in appetite.,6,5
BOBONO," So let’s forget about your plight, and go rehearse our wedding night.",6,5
CUT TO, BACKSTAGE,6,5
CLARENZO, It’s a wart. Two warts. I’ve got two fucking warts on my cock.,6,5
CAMELLO," Well, don’t worry, love. They usually go away in five or six years.",6,5
CAMELLO," Oh, wash this, darling. It stinks of me.",6,5
IZEMBARO (to BIANCA)," You can do better, Bianca, dear. You must do.",6,5
BIANCA, I had two lines.,6,5
IZEMBARO, There are no small parts. You rang very false.,6,5
BIANCA, I rang very false?,6,5
BOBONO," What you need, love, is for someone to ring you true.",6,5
BIANCA (to IZEMBARO), You weren’t complaining about me last night.,6,5
BOBONO," May I get you some wine, Lady Crane?",6,5
LADY CRANE," I’m a rum girl, Bobono. You need to know that if we’re going to be intimate.",6,5
BOBONO, Of course we’re going to be intimate.,6,5
LADY CRANE, It’s only a matter of time.,6,5
LADY CRANE, To our children.,6,5
BOBONO, May they have your talent.,6,5
LADY CRANE, And your filthy mind.,6,5
CUT TO, HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - WASHING ROOM,6,5
ARYA, A girl will poison the rum. Lady Crane is the only one who drinks it.,6,5
ARYA, If a girl could use one of the faces from the hall…,6,5
JAQEN, A girl is not ready.,6,5
ARYA, She’s a good actress.,6,5
JAQEN, So a man has heard.,6,5
ARYA, Seems like a decent woman.,6,5
JAQEN, Does death only come for the wicked and leave the decent behind?,6,5
ARYA, No. Who wants her dead?,6,5
JAQEN, That does not matter. The price was paid.,6,5
ARYA, The younger actress. She’s jealous because Lady Crane is better.,6,5
JAQEN, A girl must decide if she wants to serve the Many-Faced God.,6,5
ARYA, A girl has decided.,6,5
JAQEN, A servant does not ask questions.,6,5
CUT TO, VISION OF THE PAST - UNKNOWN LAND,6,5
MAN, No! No! No!,6,5
CUT TO, GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE,6,5
BRAN, It was you. You made the White Walkers.,6,5
LEAF, We were at war. We were being slaughtered. Our sacred trees cut down. We needed to defend ourselves.,6,5
BRAN, From whom?,6,5
LEAF, From you. From men.,6,5
AERON, We speak in the presence of the Drowned God. In his name we father today to choose a new king as our leader. Who makes a claim?,6,5
YARA," I am Yara Greyjoy, daughter of Balon Greyjoy, King of the Iron Islands. I claim the Salt Throne.",6,5
MAN #1, We’ve never had a queen. Not once.,6,5
YARA," There are many things we’ve never done. We’ve never made our mark upon the world. The great lords of Westeros pay us no mind until our little raids buzz through their kingdoms long enough to become a nuisance. Then they swat us down. They conquer us, humiliate us, and go right back to forgetting we exist.",6,5
ALL, Aye!,6,5
YARA, We are a sea people.,6,5
ALL, Aye!,6,5
YARA, Our god is a sea god.,6,5
ALL, Aye!,6,5
YARA," When I am queen, we will build a fleet that —",6,5
MAN #2, You shall not be queen!,6,5
YARA, I am not finished!,6,5
MAN #2," Yes, you are! A woman will not lead us. Not when Balon’s own male heir has returned.",6,5
THEON, I am Theon Greyjoy...last living son of Balon Greyjoy.,6,5
THEON," And she is your rightful ruler. Those of you that have sailed under her, and there are many of you here, you know what she is.",6,5
ALL, Aye!,6,5
THEON, She is a reaver!,6,5
ALL, Aye!,6,5
THEON, She is a warrior!,6,5
ALL, Aye!,6,5
THEON, She is ironborn!,6,5
ALL, Aye!,6,5
THEON, We will find no better leader. This is our queen.,6,5
EURON, I’m Euron Greyjoy.,6,5
EURON, I claim the Salt Throne.,6,5
EURON, Niece.,6,5
EURON, Nephew. Little Theon.,6,5
EURON, Heard you managed to fuck things right into the ground. Captured a castle you couldn’t keep. Got yourself taken prisoner. Even heard you have no cock.,6,5
EURON, Explains why you think a woman can be king.,6,5
YARA," When did you return, Uncle?",6,5
EURON, A few days ago. I had some things to take care of. Long overdue.,6,5
YARA, I’m glad you’re here. Now I know what my first act as queen will be. To execute the man who killed my father.,6,5
EURON, I did. I killed him. Threw him right over a rope bridge and watched him fall. He was leading us nowhere and we would still be heading there if it weren’t for me. No one loved him. No one wanted to follow him. He led ius into two wars we couldn’t win. I apologize to you all for not killing him years ago.,6,5
THEON," That would have been hard to do. You weren’t here. Last I heard, you were gallivanting around the world having a grand old time.",6,5
EURON, Gallivanting? That the sort of thing you start to say once your dick gets chopped off?,6,5
EURON, Did the great lord of Westeros teach you words like that?,6,5
THEON, You were gone. Yara was here. Being Ironborn. Leading Ironborn. Getting ready to bring us back to glory.,6,5
EURON, And how will she do that?,6,5
YARA, I will build the largest fleet the world has ever seen.,6,5
EURON," Right idea, except I’m the one who’s going to build the Iron Fleet because I’m the one who knows how to use it. I’ve been all over the world. I’ve seen more of it than all of you combined. And across the sea there is a person who hates the great lords of Westeros just as much as we do. Someone with a large army, three large dragons, and no husband. I’m going to build that fleet and I’m going to gallivant right over and give it to Daenerys Targaryen along with my big cock.",6,5
YARA, You’re going to seduce the Dragon Queen?,6,5
EURON, I’m not going to seduce her. The Iron Fleet will seduce her. And together we’re going to take the Seven Kingdoms. I wasn’t born to be king. I paid the iron price and here I stand.,6,5
CUT TO, PYKE - BEACH,6,5
AERON," May Euron, your servant, be born again from the sea as you were. Bless him with salt. Bless him with stone. Bless him with steel.",6,5
AERSON, Listen to the waves. Listen to the god. He is speaking to us and he says we shall have no king but Euron Greyjoy. Let the sea wash your follies and your vanities away. Let the old Euron drown. Let his lungs fill with seawater.,6,5
AERON, Let the fish eat the scales off his eyes.,6,5
AERON," What is dead may never die, but rises again harder and stronger.",6,5
AERON, What is dead may never die.,6,5
ALL, What is dead may never die.,6,5
EURON, Where are my niece and nephew? Let’s go murder them.,6,5
AERON, They stole our best ships.,6,5
EURON, Won’t be enough to save them.,6,5
EURON, Go back to your homes. Chop down every tree you can find. Quarter-saw the timber and start building. I want every man bending planks. I want every woman spinning flax for sails. Build me a thousand ships and I will give you this world.,6,5
DAENERYS (to JORAH), I banished you twice. You came back twice. And you saved my life. So I can’t take you back and I can’t send you away.,6,5
JORAH, You must send me away.,6,5
DAENERYS, Is there a cure?,6,5
JORAH, I don’t know.,6,5
DAENERYS, How long does it take?,6,5
JORAH, I don’t know that either. But I’ve seen what happens when it goes far enough. I’ll end things before that.,6,5
DAENERYS, I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.,6,5
JORAH," Don’t be. All I’ve ever wanted was to serve you. Tyrion Lannister was right. I love you. I’ll always love you. Goodbye, Khaleesi.",6,5
DAENERYS," Do not walk away from your queen, Jorah the Andal.",6,5
DAENERYS, You have not been dismissed. You pledged yourself to me. You swore to obey my commands for the rest of your life.,6,5
DAENERYS," Well, I command you to find the cure wherever it is in this world. I command you to heal yourself and then return to me. When I take the Seven Kingdoms, I need you by my side.",6,5
CUT TO, VAES DOTHRAK - HORSE GATE,6,5
VARYS," In the last fortnight since our pact with the Masters, how many killings have been carried out by the Sons of the Harpy?",6,5
GREY WORM, None.,6,5
VARYS, And how many Masters have been butchered by the free men.,6,5
GREY WORM," Two, but that was the day of the pact. Since then, nothing.",6,5
VARYS, So it’s safe to say that a fragile peace has taken hold.,6,5
GREY WORM, For now.,6,5
VARYS, For now is the best we get in our profession.,6,5
TYRION, It’s not enough.,6,5
VARYS," Considering the city was on the brink of civil war, I’d say it’s a good start.",6,5
TYRION," It’s not enough for Meereen to have peace. They need to know Daenerys is responsible for it. The Sons of the Harpy have a good story. Resist the foreign invaders. Our queen has an even better story. Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains and...all that.",6,5
MISSANDEI, The people know who brought them freedom.,6,5
TYRION," Yes, but do they know who brought them security? Who brought about an end to the violence? We need someone the people trust, someone they know who cannot be bought or influenced.",6,5
VARYS, Sounds like quite the hero. Where would we find him?,6,5
TYRION, Who said anything about “him”?,6,5
CUT TO, MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER,6,5
MAN (speaking Valyrian)," You stand in the presence of Kinvara, High Priestess of the Red Temple of Volantis, the Flame of Truth, the Light of Wisdom, the First Servant of the Lord of Light.",6,5
TYRION (speaking Valyrian), Welcome to Meereen.,6,5
TYRION, That’s about the extent of my Valyrian.,6,5
TYRION, Thank you for travelling all this way. I know from personal experience how uncomfortable the journey can be.,6,5
TYRION, The truth is we need your help. We had hoped that we could somehow persuade you to --,6,5
KINVARA, You don’t need to persuade me. I came to help.,6,5
KINVARA, Daenerys Stormborn is the one who was promised. From the fire she was reborn to remake the world.,6,5
TYRION, Yes.,6,5
KINVARA, She has freed the slaves from their chains and crucified the Masters for their sins.,6,5
TYRION, She did indeed.,6,5
KINVARA," Her dragons are fire made flesh, a gift from the Lord of Light. But you heard all this before, haven’t you? On the Long Bridge of Volantis. The dragons will purify nonbelievers by the thousands, burning their sins and flesh away.",6,5
TYRION, Ideally we’d avoid purifying too many nonbelievers. The Mother of Dragons has followers of many different faiths.,6,5
KINVARA," You want your queen to be worshipped and obeyed. And while she’s gone, you want her advisors to be worshipped and obeyed.",6,5
TYRION, I’d settle for obeyed.,6,5
KINVARA, I will summon my most eloquent priests. They will spread the word. Daenerys has been sent to lead the people against the darkness in this war and in the great war still to come.,6,5
TYRION, That sounds most excellent --,6,5
VARYS," A man named Stannis Baratheon was anointed as the chosen one by one of your priestesses. He, too, had a glorious destiny. He attacked King’s Landing and was soundly defeated by the man standing beside me. Last I had heard, he’d been defeated again, this time at Winterfell and this time for good.",6,5
TYRION, We’d be most grateful for any support you could provide the queen.,6,5
VARYS, I suppose it’s hard for a fanatic to admit a mistake. Isn’t that the whole point of being a fanatic? You’re always right. Everything is the Lord’s will.,6,5
KINVARA, Everything is the Lord’s will. But men and women make mistakes. Even honest servants of the Lord.,6,5
VARYS," And you, an honest servant of the lord, why should I trust you to know any more than the priestess who counseled Stannis?",6,5
TYRION," My friend has a healthy skepticism of religion, but we are all loyal supporters of the queen.",6,5
KINVARA," Everyone is what they are and where they are for a reason. Terrible things happen for a reason. Take what happened to you, Lord Varys, when you were a child. If not for your mutilation at the hand of a second-rate sorcerer, you wouldn’t be here helping the Lord’s Chosen bring his light into the world. Knowledge has made you powerful. But there’s still so much you don’t know. Do you remember what you heard that night when the sorcerer tossed your parts in the fire? You heard a voice call out from the flames. Do you remember? Should I tell you what the voice said?",6,5
KINVARA, Should I tell you the name of the one who spoke?,6,5
KINVARA," We serve the same queen. If you are her true friend, you have nothing to fear from me.",6,5

BRAN," I don’t know. He was close, but --",6,5
THREE-EYED RAVEN, He touched you.,6,5
THREE-EYED RAVEN, He knows you are here. He’ll come for you.,6,5
BRAN, But he can’t get in.,6,5
THREE-EYED RAVEN," He can now. His mark is on you. You must leave, all of you.",6,5
MEERA," Come on, Hodor. Help me with the sledge.",6,5
HODOR, Hodor.,6,5
BRAN, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to.,6,5
THREE-EYED RAVEN, The time has come.,6,5
BRAN, The time for what?,6,5
THREE-EYED RAVEN, For you to become me.,6,5
BRAN, But am I ready?,6,5
THREE-EYED RAVEN, No.,6,5
JON SNOW," We can’t defend the north from the Walkers and the south from the Boltons. If we want to survive, we need Winterfell, and to take Winterfell, we need more men.",6,5
DAVOS," Aside from the Starks and the Boltons, the most powerful houses in the North are the Umbers, the Karstarks, and the Manderlys.",6,5
DAVOS," The Umbers and the Karstarks have already declared for the Boltons, so we’re not doing so well there.",6,5
SANSA, The Umbers gave Rickon to our enemies. They can hang. But the Karstarks declared for Ramsay without knowing they had another choice.,6,5
DAVOS," I beg your pardon, my lady, but they know that a Stark beheaded their father. I don’t think we can count on them either.",6,5
SANSA," How well do you know the North, Ser Davos?",6,5
DAVOS," Precious little, my lady.",6,5
SANSA," My father always said Northerners are different. More loyal, more suspicious of outsiders.",6,5
DAVOS," They may well be loyal, but how many rose up against the Boltons when they betrayed your family? I may not know the North, but I know men. They’re more or less the same in any corner of the world and even the bravest of them don’t want to see their wives and children skinned for a lost cause. If Jon’s going to convince them to fight alongside him, they need to believe it’s a fight they can win.",6,5
JON SNOW," There are more than three other houses in the North -- Glover, Mormont, Cerwyn, Mazin, Hornwood. Two dozen more. Together they equal all the others. We can start small and build.",6,5
SANSA," The North remembers. They remember the Stark name. People will still risk everything for it, from White Harbor to Ramsay’s own door.",6,5
DAVOS, I don’t doubt it. But Jon doesn’t have the Stark name.,6,5
SANSA," No, but I do.",6,5
SANSA," Jon is every bit as much Ned Stark’s son as Ramsay is Roose Bolton’s. Ant there are also the Tullys. They’re not Northern, but they will back us against the Boltons without question.",6,5
DAVOS, I didn’t know the Tullys still had an army.,6,5
SANSA, My uncle the Blackfish has reformed it and retaken Riverrun.,6,5
JON SNOW, How do you know that?,6,5
SANSA, Ramsay received a raven before I escaped Winterfell.,6,5
DAVOS," That’s good. The Blackfish is a legend. His support would mean a great deal. Stark, Tully, a few more houses, almost starts to look like a winning side.",6,5
CUT TO, CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY,6,5
BRIENNE," I’ve sworn to protect you, my lady.",6,5
SANSA, You heard them. We need more men and my uncle has an army.,6,5
BRIENNE, We can send the Blackfish a raven.,6,5
SANSA, Can’t risk Ramsay intercepting it. It has to be you.,6,5
SANSA, Ride for Riverrun. My uncle will talk to you and you’ll know how to talk to him.,6,5
SANSA, What is it?,6,5
BRIENNE, I don’t like leaving you here alone.,6,5
SANSA, With Jon?,6,5
BRIENNE," Not him. He seems trustworthy. A bit brooding, perhaps. I suppose that’s understandable, considering. The others, though. Davos and the Red Woman helped a man murder his own brother with blood magic. And when Stannis paid for his crime, where were they? Already out looking for a leader with better prospects. And that wildling fellow with the beard --",6,5
SANSA," Jon isn’t Tormund. Jon isn’t Davos, the Red Woman, or Stannis for that matter. Jon is Jon. He’s my brother. He’ll keep me safe. I trust him.",6,5

RIDER, The dead don’t rest.,6,6
GILLY, It’s so green.,6,6
SAM," Oh, yes. Once you get south of the Riverlands, very different sorts of trees start to take over. Maple, elm, beech, poplar. The odd willow. And of course now that summer’s over, you’ll start seeing the autumn colors coming in. Still, you’ll find more green here than anywhere else.",6,6
GILLY, You’re nervous. You’re a nervous talker.,6,6
GILLY, That’s not any better being a nervous mute.,6,6
SAM," I didn’t think I’d ever come back here after my father made me renounce my title and inheritance and, well, threaten to kill me if I didn’t. A person just doesn’t feel welcome at that point.",6,6
SAM, And I certainly didn’t expect to be introducing him to my family. So you know what to tell them.,6,6
GILLY, That Little Sam is your baby.,6,6
SAM," Yes, now that’s very important. If he thinks that Little Sam is his grandchild, he’ll take you in. He’ll get an education. He’ll learn to read. And you can help teach him. Huh?",6,6
GILLY, What did you tell your family about me?,6,6
SAM, I told them I met you in the North.,6,6
GILLY, Did you tell them how far north?,6,6
SAM," Well, it wasn’t a very large piece of parchment.",6,6
GILLY, You didn’t tell them where I’m really from? You didn’t tell them I’m a wildling?,6,6
SAM," The thing is...my father doesn’t like wildlings. He hoped I’d make a man of myself by “killing some bloody wildlings,” so it’s probably a good subject to avoid if at all possible.",6,6

TOMMEN, Is there no other way?,6,6
HIGH SPARROW, You’re afraid for her?,6,6
TOMMEN, Of course I’m afraid for her! It just seems very dangerous.,6,6
HIGH SPARROW, She’ll be protected the entire way. The Faith Militant are very stern with those who overstep their bounds. And Queen Margaery isn’t your mother. I suspect the gods will predispose the common people to gentleness on her behalf. She’s truly opened her heart to them.,6,6
TOMMEN, She’s always been very devoted to the poor and the unfortunate.,6,6

MARGAERY," Have you spoken to him at all, the High Sparrow?",6,6
TOMMEN," Yes, a few times. Have you?",6,6
MARGAERY," Yes, I have. He’s not quite what we thought he was, is he?",6,6
MARGAERY, You think I’m mad. I sound mad.,6,6
TOMMEN," No. No, you don’t. You- - you could never. You’re right, he’s not. He’s a lot more- -",6,6
MARGAERY, He is. There’s something about him. His way of looking at the world. It’s not an easy thing admitting to yourself what you really are. It’s taken me a while. He’s helped me.,6,6
TOMMEN, What are you talking about? You’re a good person. You’ve always been a good person. You’re the best person I know.,6,6
TOMMEN, I was just telling him about your devotion to the poor.,6,6
MARGAERY," Ah, yes, I visited their hovels and I fed them soup and I made sure I was seen doing it. I never gave them what they really needed, though. I’ve had lots of time to think about how good I was at seeming good. All those stories I told myself about who I was and why I did the things I did. There were so many lies in those stories.",6,6
TOMMEN, I don’t understand.,6,6
MARGAERY, It’s all right. It really is. It’s such a relief to let go of those lies.,6,6
TOMMEN, What about Loras?,6,6
MARGAERY," I love my brother. I will always love my brother. His soul is pure and perfect. His sins don’t erase that purity, they only obscure it. He just needs to atone for them. We all do. Sooner or later, one way or another. The gods have a plan for us all.",6,6

SAM," Oh, of course. Sorry. Long journey.",6,6
DICKON, Brought it down from 70 yards. One shot.,6,6
SAM," Oh, that’s a fair distance.",6,6
DICKON, So do you do much hunting up at the wall?,6,6
SAM," Oh, yes. Yes. A good amount. North of the Wall, you don’t hunt, you don’t eat.",6,6
DICKON, Mm-hmmm. Mostly deer or is it elk as well?,6,6
SAM," Rabbits. Sometimes squirrels. I say “we,” it’s my friend Jon mostly. Sometimes Edd. Oh, and Gilly. She’s- - she’s quite a good hunter as well. Um, huntress.",6,6
MELESSA (to GILLY)," I imagine it’s common where you’re from. We once met a man, Lord Umber from Last Hearth, wasn’t it, Randyll, who said he taught all his daughters how to hunt.",6,6
TALLA, Your father taught you to hunt? Our father would never teach us. I think our father could learn a thing or two from your father.,6,6
RANDYLL, That’s enough of that.,6,6
MELESSA," Samwell, would you care for more bread?",6,6
SAM," Oh, yes. Yes, please. Thank you, Mother.",6,6
RANDYLL, Not fat enough already?,6,6
SAM, I travelled south under orders from the Lord Commander. He wants me to- -,6,6
RANDYLL, I read your letter. You’re to be a maester.,6,6
SAM," Yes. And once I have my chain, I’ll return to Castle Black.",6,6
RANDYLL, I thought the Night’s Watch might make a man of you. Something resembling a man at least. You managed to stay soft and fat.,6,6
RANDYLL, Your nose buried in books. Spending your life reading about the achievements of better men. I’ll wager you still can’t sit a horse or wield a sword.,6,6
MELESSA," Randyll, to be maester of the Night’s Watch is a great honor.",6,6
GILLY, He can wield a sword. He killed a Thenn. He killed a White Walker.,6,6
DICKON, There’s no such thing.,6,6
GILLY, I saw it with my own eyes on our way down to Castle Black. He drove a dagger into the walker’s heart. He risked his own life to save mine more than once. He’s a greater warrior than either of you will ever be.,6,6
RANDYLL, Your way down to Castle Black? Where did he kill a white walker? Where are you from? How’d you come to meet my son?,6,6
GILLY, The Night’s Watch came to our keep.,6,6
RANDYLL, Where?,6,6
SAM, Gilly.,6,6
GILLY, North of the Wall.,6,6
RANDYLL, North of the Wall? You’re a Wildling. The Seven Kingdoms have waged war against these savages for centuries and here I sit hosting one in my hall thanks to my son. See that sword?,6,6
RANDYLL," It’s called Heartsbane. It’s been in our family for 500 years. It’s Valyrian steel. Only a handful of them left in the world. It’s supposed to go to my firstborn son after I die. To him. He will never wield that sword. If he were to become Lord Tarly of Horn Hill, it would be the end of this house. I took you for a Mole’s Town whore when I saw you and I made my peace with that. Who else would have him? But I overestimated him. No. It was a wildling whore that seduced my son. This you getting back at me, boy? Hmm? Bring that to my table and making me dine with it. And you got what you were after, didn’t you? A bastard. A half-breed bastard. Your invitation into our home.",6,6
MELESSA," Come, my dear. Talla.",6,6
MELESSA, I’ve lost my appetite.,6,6
RANDYLL, He dishonors us.,6,6
MELESSA, You dishonor yourself.,6,6
RANDYLL (to SAM)," Your mother’s a fine woman. You’re not worthy of her. To please her, I’ll take the wildling in. She can work in the kitchens. The bastard will be raised here. But this will be the last night you ever spend at Horn Hill.",6,6

LADY CRANE, Did you pay?,6,6
ARYA, No.,6,6
LADY CRANE," I remember when the players came to my village. I didn’t have any money, so I snuck in. Just like you. Saw the painted faces, the costumes, listened to the songs, cried when the young lovers died in each other’s arms. I ran off and joined them the next day, never looked back.",6,6
ARYA, You’re very good.,6,6
LADY CRANE, My final speech is shit.,6,6
LADY CRANE," But to be fair to myself, which I always like to be, the writing’s no good.",6,6
ARYA," So change it. It would all just be farting, belching, and slapping without you.",6,6
LADY CRANE, How would you change it?,6,6
ARYA, The queen loves her son more than anything. And he was taken from her before she could say good-bye. She wouldn’t just cry. She would be angry. She would want to kill the person who did this to her.,6,6
LADY CRANE, What’s your name?,6,6

HIGH SPARROW, The gods don’t recognize his authority in this matter.,6,6
JAIME, You already insulted one great house. It won’t happen twice. Every last sparrow will die before Margaery walks down that street.,6,6
HIGH SPARROW, To die in the service of the gods would please each and every one of us. We yearn for it. But there is no call for it today. There will be no walk of atonement.,6,6

TOMMEN, I have to answer to the gods.,6,6
JAIME, Not when you’re sitting in that chair.,6,6
TOMMEN, The Crown’s decision on this matter is final.,6,6
JAIME, Will I be walking naked in the streets? Or will I spend a few months in the sept dungeons first to teach me about the gods’ mercy?,6,6
TOMMEN, You have served your house and your king faithfully for many years. And you will continue to do so. But not in this city.,6,6
WALDER, You’ve lost it?,6,6
BLACK WALDER," Yes, father.",6,6
WALDER," It’s a castle, not a bloody sheep. Presumably you still know where it is. You didn’t lose Riverrun. You let the Blackfish take it from you.",6,6
LOTHAR, He surprised us. He knows the castle better than anyone.,6,6
WALDER," You did lose the Blackfish after the Red Wedding. You had him right here in this hall and you let him leave. Then when I told you to hunt him down and kill him, you couldn’t find him. That’s what it means to lose something. Now he’s come back and taken Riverrun.",6,6
BLACK WALDER, I don’t think it’s fair to blame us- -,6,6
WALDER," For 300 years we kissed Tully boots, swore oaths to them and their stinking fish banners. Not again. Riverrun is ours. Take it back.",6,6
BLACK WALDER, We don’t have the men.,6,6
WALDER, We’ve got 10 times as many men as the damn Blackfish.,6,6
BLACK WALDER, The Mallisters have risen against us. And the Blackwoods.,6,6
LOTHAR," The Brotherhood Without Banners is rallying the commoners against us, raiding our supply trains and camps.",6,6
BLACK WALDER, Riverrun can withstand a siege for a year.,6,6

WALDER," I hear it in my sleep! I’m not dead yet, unfortunately for you. And I’ll not leave this world until they all choke on that laughter. Take that castle back.",6,6
LOTHAR," He’ll never yield, Father.",6,6
WALDER," Oh, he’ll yield.",6,6
WALDER," You’ll show him the knife you used to kill Robb Stark’s child in his whore mother’s belly, and you’ll show him the knife you used to open his niece’s throat. And you’ll remind him who it was that got married at the Red Wedding in the first place. His nephew.",6,6
WALDER," Cheer up, Lord Edmure. You’re going home.",6,6
JAIME, I’m being sent to deal with the Blackfish. Apparently Walder Frey can’t manage it on his own because he’s 400 years old. Sent me with an army to the Riverlands and a siege that could last months.,6,6
CERSEI, BEtter you’re elsewhere at the head of an army than in the sept dungeons.,6,6
JAIME, I’m not going to the Riverlands.,6,6
CERSEI," What, then?",6,6
JAIME, I’m going to give Bronn the largest bag of gold anyone’s ever seen and have him gather the best killers he knows. I’ll take them to the sept and I’ll remove the High Sparrow’s head and every other sparrow head I can find.,6,6
CERSEI, You can’t.,6,6
JAIME, He has our son! He stole our son! He’s torn our family apart. How should we treat people who tear us apart?,6,6
CERSEI," We should treat them without mercy and we will. But if you kill the High Sparrow, you won’t leave the sept alive. And without you, this is all for nothing. Stand at the head of our army where you belong, where Father wanted you. Show our men where their loyalties belong. Show them what lannisters are, what we do to our enemies. And take that stupid little castle back because it’s ours and because you can.",6,6
JAIME, You’ll stand trial soon. I need to he here for you.,6,6
CERSEI," It will be a trial by combat. I have the Mountain. They’ve made us both stronger, all of them.",6,6
CERSEI, They have no idea how strong we are. No idea what we’re going to do to them.,6,6
CERSEI, We’ve always been together. We’ll always be together. We’re the only two people in the world.,6,6
MEERA, Why did you help us?,6,6
RIDER, The Three-Eyed Raven sent for me.,6,6
MEERA, The Three-Eyed Raven’s dead.,6,6
RIDER, Now he lives again.,6,6
RIDER (to BRAN)," When I last saw you, you were a boy. A fearless boy. Loved to climb the castle walls, frighten his mother.",6,6
BRAN, Who are you?,6,6
BRAN, Uncle Benjen. The last letter Jon wrote me said you had been lost beyond the Wall.,6,6
BENJEN, I led a ranging party deep into the North to find White Walkers. They found us. A white walker stabbed me in the gut with a sword of ice. Left me there to die. To turn. The Children found me. Stopped the walker’s magic from taking hold.,6,6
BRAN, How?,6,6
BENJEN, The same way they made the Walkers in the first place. You saw it yourself.,6,6
BRAN, Dragonglass. A shard of dragonglass plunged into your heart.,6,6
BENJEN, You are the Three-Eyed Raven now.,6,6
BRAN, I didn’t have time to learn. I can’t control anything.,6,6
BENJEN, You must learn to control it before the Night King comes.,6,6
BENJEN, Drink.,6,6
BENJEN," One way or another, he will find his way to the world of men. When he does, you will be there waiting for him. And you will be ready.",6,6
DAARIO, Everything all right?,6,6
DAENERYS, How many days’ ride to Meereen?,6,6
DAARIO, A week at best.,6,6
DAENERYS, How many ships will I need to bring my khalasar to Westeros?,6,6
DAARIO," Dothraki and all their horses, the Unsullied, the Second Sons- - 1,000 ships easily. Probably more.",6,6
DAENERYS, And who has that many?,6,6
DAARIO, Nobody.,6,6
DAENERYS, Nobody yet.,6,6
DAARIO, So we ride for Meereen and after that we sail for Westeros. What then?,6,6
DAENERYS, I take what is mine.,6,6
DAARIO, You weren’t made to sit on a chair in a palance.,6,6
DAENERYS, What was I made for?,6,6
DAARIO," You’re a conqueror, Daenerys Stormborn.",6,6
DAENERYS, Wait here.,6,6
DAARIO (speaking Dothraki), I’m going after her. Wait for me here.,6,6
DAENERYS (speaking Dothraki), Every khal who ever lived chose three blood riders to fight beside him and guard his way. But I am not a khal. I will not choose three blood riders. I choose you all.,6,6
DAENERYS (speaking Dothraki), I will ask more of you than any khal has ever asked of his khalassar! Will you ride the wooden horses across the black salt sea?,6,6
DAENERYS, Will you kill my enemies in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses?,6,6
DAENERYS," Will you give me the Seven Kingdoms, the gift Khal Drogo promised me before the Mother of Mountains?",6,6
DAENERYS, Are you with me?,6,6
DAENERYS, Now and always?,6,6

RAY," Here you are, son.",6,7
RAY," Oh, gentlemen, please.",6,7
RAY, In all my days I’ve never seen a man swing an ax like that. How many men did it take to cut you down?,6,7
SANDOR, Just one.,6,7
RAY, Ooh. he must have been some kind of monster.,6,7
SANDOR, He was a woman.,6,7
CUT TO, BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT,6,7
RAY, I think some of the men are a bit afraid of you.,6,7
SANDOR, I’m used to it.,6,7
RAY," When I found you, I thought you’d been dead for days. The way you were stinking already and you had bugs all over you and bone was coming through right there.",6,7
RAY," I was gonna give you a proper burial and then you coughed. Oh, nearly shit myself. I reckoned you were gonna die by the time I loaded you on the wagon, but you didn’t. Now, I reckoned you’d die a dozen more times over the next few days, but you didn’t. What kept you going?",6,7
SANDOR, Hate.,6,7
RAY," No, there’s a reason you’re still here.",6,7
SANDOR," Aye, there’s a reason. I’m a big fucker and I’m tough to kill.",6,7
RAY," No, a reason. Gods aren’t done with you yet.",6,7
SANDOR," I’ve heard that before. Man was talking about a different god, though.",6,7
RAY," Well, maybe he was right. I don’t know much about the gods.",6,7
SANDOR, You’re in the wrong line of work.,6,7
RAY," Oh, there’s plenty of pious sons of bitches who think they know the word of god or gods. I don’t. I don’t even know their real names. Maybe it is the Seven. Or maybe it’s the old gods. Or maybe it’s the Lord of Light. Or maybe they’re all the same fucking thing. I don’t know. What matters, I believe, is that there’s something greater than us. And whatever it is, it’s got plans for Sandor Clegane.",6,7
SANDOR, You didn’t know me back in my time. You don’t know the things I’ve done.,6,7
RAY, I’ve heard stories.,6,7
SANDOR, If the gods are real...why haven’t they punished me?,6,7
RAY, They have.,6,7
HIGH SPARROW, Your Grace. What are we reading today?,6,7
MARGAERY," The Book of the Mother, Your Holiness. Chapter three, verse 12.",6,7
HIGH SPARROW," Ah, “As water rounds the stones, smoothing- -”",6,7
MARGAERY," “Smoothing what was jagged, so does a woman’s love calm a man’s brute nature. A wife salves her husband’s wounds, a mother sings her son to sleep.”",6,7
HIGH SPARROW," You learn quickly. There are some who know every verse of the sacred text, but don’t have a drop of the Mother’s mercy in their blood and savages who can’t read at all who understand the Father’s wisdom.",6,7
MARGAERY," For year I pretended to love the poor, the afflicted. I had pity for them, but I never loved them. They disgusted me.",6,7
HIGH SPARROW, They are hard to love.,6,7
HIGH SPARROW," The poor disgust us because they are us, shorn of our illusions. They show us what we’d look like without our fine clothes. How’d we smell without perfume.",6,7
HIGH SPARROW, Can I ask you about a personal matter?,6,7
MARGAERY, Of course.,6,7
HIGH SPARROW," The king mentioned that since your reunion, you haven’t joined him in the marriage bed.",6,7
MARGAERY, No.,6,7
HIGH SPARROW," You have a duty, Your Grace. To your husband, your king, your country, to the gods themselves.",6,7
MARGAERY, It’s just...the desires that once drove me no longer do.,6,7
HIGH SPARROW," Congress does not require desire on the woman’s part, only patience. The king must have an heir if we are to continue our good work.",6,7
MARGAERY, Forgive me. Sometimes the truth path is hard to find.,6,7
HIGH SPARROW, Hard to find and harder still to walk upon. But you’ve made great progress. I only pray your grandmother follows your lead.,6,7
MARGAERY, My grandmother?,6,7
HIGH SPARROW," Yes. The Queen of Thorns is a remarkable woman, a strong woman, and an unrepentant sinner. You must teach her the new way as she taught you the old. Or I fear for her safety, body and soul.",6,7
CUT TO, RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER,6,7
OLENNA, Does it move or talk? I want to speak with you alone.,6,7
MARGAERY, Septa Unella has been my true friend and counselor.,6,7
OLENNA," Oh, this is madness!",6,7
OLENNA (to SEPTA UNELLA)," You’re not in your sanctuary now, my dear. All I have to do is whistle and my men will stroll in here and bash you about...",6,7
MARGAERY, Grandmother.,6,7
OLENNA, ...until I tell them to stop. If I tell them to stop. You could use a good bashing.,6,7
MARGAERY," Grandmother, please.",6,7
OLENNA, What have they done to you?,6,7
MARGAERY," You marched against the High Sparrow, against the Faith.",6,7
OLENNA, We marched for you.,6,7
MARGAERY," The gods could have punished you and Father, but they didn’t. They showed mercy.",6,7
OLENNA, And what about your brother? What mercy did they show him?,6,7
MARGAERY," Loras’s only hope is to confess his crimes and repent. If he does, the Faith will allow him to return to Highgarden. He’ll have to renounce his name and title...",6,7
OLENNA, Have you lost your mind?,6,7
MARGAERY, ...and live his life as a penitent.,6,7
OLENNA," He is the heir to Highgarden, the future of House Tyrell.",6,7
MARGAERY, He can begin again.,6,7
OLENNA, As a mindless fanatic.,6,7
MARGAERY, As a free man.,6,7
OLENNA, You will leave for Highgarden today. There is no law that says you must stay here.,6,7
MARGAERY, I am the queen. It is my duty to serve my husband the king.,6,7
MARGAERY," But you should leave, Grandmother. Your place is at home.",6,7
OLENNA, I will never leave you. Never.,6,7
MARGAERY, You must.,6,7
MARGAERY, Go home. Find comfort in prayer and good works.,6,7
MARGAERY, The Mother watches over us all.,6,7

CUT TO, RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY,6,7
DIM DALBA," We said we’d fight with you, King Crow, when the time comes and we meant it, but this isn’t what we agreed to. These aren’t White Walkers. This isn’t an army of the dead. This isn’t our find.",6,7
TORMUND," If it weren’t for him, none of us would be here. All of you would be meat in the Night King’s army. And I’d be a pile of charred bones just like Mance.",6,7
DIM DALBA," Remember Mance’s camp? It stretched all the way to the horizon. And look at us now. Look what’s left of us. And if we lose this, we’re gone. Dozens of tribes, hundreds of generations. Be like we were never there at all. We’ll be the last of the free folk.",6,7
JON SNOW," That’s what’ll happen to you if we lose. The Boltons, the Karstarks, the Umbers, they know you’re here. They know that more than half of you are women and children. After they finish with me, they’ll come for you. You’re right. This isn’t your fight. You shouldn’t have to come to Winterfell with me. I shouldn’t be asking you. It’s not the deal we made. I need you with me if we’re gonna beat them, and we need to beat them if you’re going to survive.",6,7
TORMUND," The crows killed him because he spoke for the free folk when no other southerners would. He died for us. If we are not willing to do the same for him, we’re cowards. And if that’s what we are, we deserve to be the last of the free folk.",6,7
WUN WUN, Snow.,6,7
JON SNOW (to TORMUND), Are you sure they’ll come?,6,7
TORMUND," We’re not clever like you southerners. When we say we’ll do something, we do it.",6,7
CERSEI, I heard you were leaving King’s Landing.,6,7
OLENNA, That is hardly your concern.,6,7
CERSEI, Your grandson is still a prisoner. You’ll leave him rotting in a cell?,6,7
OLENNA, Loras rots in a cell because of you. THe High Sparrow rules this city because of you. Our two ancient houses face collapse because of you and your stupidity.,6,7
CERSEI, You’re right. I made a terrible mistake. I carry it with me every single day.,6,7
OLENNA, Good.,6,7
CERSEI, I delivered an army of fanatics onto our doorstep. And now we must fight them together. We need each other.,6,7
OLENNA," I wonder if you’re the worst person I’ve ever met. At a certain age, it’s hard to recall. But the truly vile do stand out through the years. Do you remember the way you smirked at me when my grandson and granddaughter were dragged off to their cells? I do. I’ll never forget it.",6,7
CERSEI, You love your granddaughter. I love my son. It’s the only truth I know. We must defend them.,6,7
OLENNA," I’m leaving this wretched city as fast as I can before that shoeless zealot throws me into one of his cells. If you’re half as bright as you think you are, you’ll find your way out of here, too.",6,7
CERSEI, Never. I’ll never leave my son.,6,7
OLENNA," What’ll you do, then? You have no support. Not anymore. Your brother’s gone. The High Sparrow saw to that. The rest of your family have abandoned you. The people despise you. You’re surrounded by enemies, thousands of them. You’re going to kill them all by yourself? You’ve lost, Cersei. It’s the only joy I can find in all this misery.",6,7
MAN, Pick the pace up. Keep going.,6,7
MAN #2, Keep it moving!,6,7
BRONN," Now, that is a sorry attempt at a siege. Someone needs to teach those sad twats how to dig trenches.",6,7
JAIME, Someone certainly does.,6,7
BRONN," Oh, no. Not me. I’m just an upjumped sellsword.",6,7
JAIME, You’re an anointed knight. There’s quite a difference.,6,7
BRONN," Aye, knights don’t get paid.",6,7
JAIME, You have better instincts than any officer in the Lannister army.,6,7
BRONN, That’s like saying I have a bigger cock than anyone in the Unsullied army.,6,7
JAIME, I expect to command all the Lannister forces before long. You can be the right hand I lost.,6,7
BRONN, You promised me a lordship and a castle and a highborn beauty for a wife.,6,7

LOTHAR, This is your last warning. Yield the castle.,6,7
BLACK WALDER," You think I won’t do it, old man?",6,7
BLACK WALDER, I sliced your niece’s throat from ear to ear. And where were you? Running and hiding like a fucking coward. Yield the castle or I cut his throat.,6,7
BRYNDEN," Go on, then. Cut his throat.",6,7
JAIME," Lothar, is it?",6,7
LOTHAR, Ser Jaime. We didn’t know you were coming.,6,7
JAIME," ‘Cause you didn’t set up a proper perimeter. You just allowed 8,000 men to approach unchallenged.",6,7
BRONN, Good thing we’re friends or we’d be fucking you in the ass right now.,6,7
JAIME, Have Lord Edmure bathed and fed.,6,7
BLACK WALDER," Whoa, whoa.",6,7
LOTHAR, Walder.,6,7
BLACK WALDER, Edmure is a prisoner of House Frey.,6,7
JAIME," Only a fool makes threats he’s not prepared to carry out. Now let’s say I threatened to hit you unless you shut your mouth, but you kept talking. What do you think I’d do?",6,7
BLACK WALDER, I don’t give a rat’s- -,6,7
JAIME, I’m here by the king’s command to take back this castle. Have him bathed and fed. Unless you’d like to take his place.,6,7
LOTHAR," Apologies, Ser Jaime.",6,7
LOTHAR, Do as he says.,6,7
JAIME," The siege is now under my command. The next time the Blackfish looks out from those ramparts, he’ll see an army at his gates, not whatever this is.",6,7
BRONN, Have your lads start digging perimeter trenches. Set pickets every hundred yards. And work double-time on those siege towers and trebuchets.,6,7
BLACK WALDER, Those are our siege towers- -,6,7
JAIME," As I said, the siege is under my command. If that’s not to your liking, go home.",6,7
JAIME, Get word to the Blackfish. I want a parley.,6,7

JON SNOW, Lady Mormont.,6,7
LYANNA, Welcome to Bear Island.,6,7
SANSA," I remember when you were born, my lady. You were named for my Aunt Lyanna. It was said she was a great beauty. I’m sure you will be, too.",6,7
LYANNA," I doubt it. My mother wasn’t a great beauty or any other kind of beauty. She was a great warrior, though. She died fighting for your brother, Robb.",6,7
JON SNOW," I served under your uncle at Castle Black, Lady Lyanna. He was also a great warrior and an honorable man. I was his steward. In fact- -",6,7
LYANNA, I think we’ve had enough small talk. What are you here?,6,7
JON SNOW, Stannis Baratheon garrisoned at Castle Black before he marched on Winterfell and was killed. He showed me the letter you wrote to him when he petitioned for men. It said- -,6,7
LYANNA, I remember what it said. “Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North whose name is Stark.”,6,7
JON SNOW," Robb is gone, but House Stark is not. And it needs your support now more than ever. I’ve come with my sister to ask for House Mormont’s allegiance.",6,7
LYANNA," As far as I understand, you’re a Snow and Lady Sansa is a Bolton. Or is she a Lannister? I’ve heard conflicting reports.",6,7
SANSA," I did what I had to do to survive, my lady. But I am a Stark. I will always be a Stark.",6,7
LYANNA," If you say so. In any case, you don’t just want my allegiance. You want my fighting men.",6,7
JON SNOW," Ramsay Bolton cannot be allowed to keep Winterfell, my lady. It is our duty to stop him. Even more so because he holds our brother Rickon Stark as prisoner. What you have to understand, my lady, is that- -",6,7
LYANNA, I understand that I’m responsible for Bear Island and all who live here. So why should I sacrifice one more Mormont life for someone else’s war?,6,7
DAVOS," If it please, my lady, I understand how you feel.",6,7
LYANNA," I don’t know you, Ser…?",6,7
DAVOS," Davos, my lady, of House Seaworth.",6,7
DAVOS, You needn’t ask your maester about my house. It’s rather new.,6,7
LYANNA," All right, Ser Davos of House Seaworth. How is it you understand how I feel?",6,7
DAVOS," You never thought you’d find yourself in your position. Being responsible for so many lives at such a young age. I never thought I’d be in my position. I was a crabber’s son, then I was a smuggler. And now I found myself addressing the lady of a great house in time of war. But I’m here because this isn’t someone else’s war. It’s our war.",6,7
LYANNA," Go on, Ser Davos.",6,7
DAVOS," Your uncle, Lord Commander Mormont, made that man his steward. He chose Jon to be his successor because he knew had the courage to do what was right, even if it meant giving his life. Because Jeor Mormont and Jon Snow both understood that the real war isn’t between a few squabbling houses. It’s between the living and the dead. And make no mistake, my lady, the dead are coming.",6,7
LYANNA, Is this true?,6,7
JON SNOW, Your uncle fought them at the Fist of the First Men. I fought them at Hardhome. We both lost.,6,7
DAVOS," As long as the Boltons hold Winterfell, the North is divided. And a divided North won’t stand a chance against the Night King. You want to protect your people, my lady. I understand. But there’s no hiding from this. We have to fight and we need to do it together.",6,7
LYANNA," House Mormont has kept faith with House Stark for 1,000 years. We will not break faith today.",6,7
JON SNOW," Thank you, my lady. How many fighting men can we expect?",6,7
LYANNA, 62.,6,7
JON SNOW, 62?,6,7
LYANNA," We are not a large house, but we’re a proud one. And every man from Bear Island fights with the strength of 10 mainlanders.",6,7
DAVOS," If they’re half as ferocious as their lady, the Boltons are doomed.",6,7
BRYNDEN, Kingslayer.,6,7
JAIME, Blackfish.,6,7
BRYNDEN, I assume you’re here to fulfill the vow you gave my niece. I don’t see Sansa and Arya.,6,7
JAIME, I don’t have them.,6,7
BRYNDEN, Pity. Do you wish to resume your captivity?,6,7
BRYNDEN, Then why are you here?,6,7
JAIME," You know why I’m here. This castle belongs to House Frey. You’re trespassing. In the name of King Tommen, I order you to surrender or- -",6,7
BRYNDEN, Or you’ll kill Edmure?,6,7
BRYNDEN, My nephew’s marked for death no matter what. Hang him and be done with it.,6,7
JAIME, It won’t stop with Edmure. You’ll force me to storm the castle. Hundreds will die.,6,7
BRYNDEN, Hundreds of mine. Thousands of yours. If you can breach the walls.,6,7
JAIME," We’ll breach them and kill every last one of you. But if you surrender, I’ll spare the lives of your men. On my honor.",6,7
BRYNDEN, Your honor? Bargaining with oathbreakers is like building on quicksand.,6,7
JAIME," The war is over, ser. Why sacrifice living men to a lost cause?",6,7
BRYNDEN," As long as I’m standing, the war is not over. This is my home. I was born in this castle and I’m ready to die in it. So you can either attack or try to starve us out. We have enough provisions for two years. Do you have two years, Kingslayer?",6,7
JAIME, You clearly have no intention of saving your men’s lives. Why did you come to treat with me?,6,7
BRYNDEN," Sieges are dull. And I wanted to see you in person, get the measure of you.",6,7
JAIME," Well, now you have.",6,7
BRYNDEN," Aye, now I have. I’m disappointed.",6,7
ROBETT, The answer is no.,6,7
JON SNOW," Lord Glover, if you could just hear us out.",6,7
ROBETT, I’ve heard enough. We’ve only just taken back this castle from the Ironborn. The Boltons helped us do it. Now you want me to fight against them? I could be skinned for even talking to you.,6,7
JON SNOW, The Boltons are traitors. Roose Bolton- -,6,7
ROBETT, Have other northern houses pledged to fight for you?,6,7
JON SNOW, House Mormont.,6,7
ROBETT, And?,6,7
JON SNOW, We sent raven to Houses Manderly- -,6,7
ROBETT, I don’t care about ravens. You’re asking me to join your army. Who is fighting in this army?,6,7
JON SNOW, The bulk of the force is made up of wildlings.,6,7
ROBETT, Then the rumors are true. I didn’t dare believe them. I received you out of respect for your father. Now I would like you to leave. House Glover will not abandon its ancestral home to fight alongside wildlings.,6,7
JON SNOW, Lord Glover.,6,7
ROBETT, There’s nothing else to say.,6,7
SANSA, I would remind you that House Glover is pledged to House Stark. Sworn to answer when called upon.,6,7
ROBETT," Yes, my family served House Stark for centuries. We wept when we heard of your father’s death. When my brother was lord of this castle, he answered Robb’s call and hailed him King in the North.",6,7
ROBETT, And where was King Robb when the Ironborn attacked this castle? When they threw my wife and children in prison and brutalized and killed our subjects? Taking up with a foreign whore. Getting himself and those who followed him killed.,6,7
ROBETT," I served House Stark once, but House Stark is dead.",6,7

THEON, Why did we have to come here?,6,7
YARA, Some of us still like it. Have a drink at least.,6,7
THEON, I don’t want one.,6,7
YARA," Don’t go far, love.",6,7
YARA, I’ll find you in a bit.,6,7
YARA, Nothing on the Iron Islands has an ass like that. Doesn’t interest you anymore?,6,7
YARA," I’m sorry. I won’t joke about it. I’ll never hurt you, little brother. Don’t you know that?",6,7
THEON, You think Uncle Euron’s hunting for us?,6,7
YARA," Of course he is. As long as we’re alive, we’re a threat.",6,7
THEON, He’ll find us.,6,7
YARA, It’s a great big world and we have fast ships. Drink.,6,7
THEON, I don’t want any.,6,7
YARA, I don’t care what you want. Drink.,6,7
YARA, Drink it all.,6,7
YARA," You’re Ironborn, Theon. I know you’ve had some bad years.",6,7
THEON, Some bad years?,6,7
YARA, But I’m tired of watching you cower like a beat dog. Drink the goddamn ale.,6,7
YARA," Now listen to me. I need you. The real Theon Greyjoy, not this rat shit pretender. Can you find him for me? Drink.",6,7
YARA," You escaped, do you hear me? You got away and you’re never going back. We’ll get justice for you.",6,7
THEON," If I got justice, my burnt body would hang over the gates of Winterfell.",6,7
YARA," Fuck justice, then. We’ll get revenge. Drink.",6,7
YARA," Listen to me. If you’re so broken that there’s no coming back, take a knife and cut your wrists. End it. But if you’re staying, Theon, I need you. We’re gonna sail to Meereen. We’re gonna make a pact with this Dragon Queen. And we’re gonna take back the Iron Islands.",6,7
YARA, Are you with me? Are you really with me?,6,7
YARA," Now, since it’s my last night ashore for a long while, I’m gonna go fuck the tits off this one.",6,7
DAVOS, Stannis camped here on his way to Winterfell.,6,7
SANSA, And that’s a good thing?,6,7
DAVOS, He was the most experienced commander in Westeros. He chose this place for a reason. Those mountains are a natural fortification. There’s a stream down there for the horses.,6,7
JON SNOW, We’re not staying here long. Another storm could hit any day..,6,7
DAVOS," Aye, the snows defeated Stannis as much as the Boltons did.",6,7
JON SNOW, We have to march on Winterfell now while we still can.,6,7

RAY," I was a soldier once. All my superiors thought I was brave. I wasn’t. I mean, I never ran from a fight. Only because I was afraid my friends would see I was afraid. That’s all I was, a coward. We followed orders no matter the orders. Burn that village. Fine, I’m your arsonist. Steal that farmer’s crops. Good, I’m your thief. Kill those young lads so they won’t take up arms against us. I’m your murderer. I remember once a woman screaming at us, calling us animals as we dragged her son from their hut. But we weren’t animals. Animals are true to their nature and we had betrayed ours. I cut that young boy’s throat myself as his mother screamed and my friends held her back.",6,7
RAY," That night...I felt such shame. Shame was so heavy on me, I couldn’t eat, I couldn’t sleep.",6,7
RAY, All I could do was stare into that dark sky and listen to that mother screaming her son’s name. I’ll hear her screaming the rest of my life.,6,7
RAY," Now, I know I can never bring that lad back. All I can do with time I’ve got left is bring a little goodness into the world. That’s all any of us can do, isn’t it? Never too late to stop robbing people, to stop killing people. Start helping people.",6,7
RAY, It’s never too late to come back.,6,7
RAY, And it’s not about waiting for the gods to answer your prayers. It’s not even about the gods. It’s about you. Learning you have to answer your prayers yourself.,6,7

Shut your blue eyes, my love. Let the crown fall. The Father above beckons you into his hall. In Seventh Heaven I’ll see you once more. But now I seek vengeance on Sansa the whore and my brother the Imp who killed his own king. Born amongst lions, our curse from within. I will slay him, I swear.

ARYA, You’re good at that. Where did you learn?,6,8
LADY CRANE, I’m a jealous woman. I’ve always liked bad men and they’ve always liked me. They’d come home wherever home was that night stinking of some whore’s perfume.,6,8
LADY CRANE," So we’d fight and I’d put a hole in them. And then I’d feel terrible, so I’d patch them up. I got good at patching them up.",6,8

LADY CRANE, And that.,6,8

PODRICK, I’m her squire.,6,8
BRONN," Oh. Well, he’d fuck her, that’s for sure. And she’s fuck him, don’t you think? The way she looks at him. The way all women look at him is frankly irritating. I preferred working with the little brother on that account. Come on, you’re the one with the magic cock.",6,8

BRIENNE, I don’t think you know many girls like her.,6,8
JAIME," Well, I’m proud of you. I am. You fulfilled your oath to Catelyn Stark against all odds.",6,8

BRIENNE, I’ve come for the Blackfish.,6,8
JAIME, You’re welcome to have him.,6,8
BRIENNE, Lady Sansa desires to take her ancestral seat back from the Boltons and assume her rightful position as Lady of Winterfell.,6,8
JAIME, With what army does she plan on taking Winterfell?,6,8
BRIENNE, The Tully army.,6,8
JAIME," They’re a bit occupied at the moment. I was sent here to reclaim Riverrun currently defended by the Tully rebels, so you can see the conundrum.",6,8
BRIENNE, The Tullys are rebels because they’re fighting for their home?,6,8
JAIME, Riverrun was granted to the Freys by royal decree.,6,8
BRIENNE, As a reward for betraying Robb Stark and slaughtering his family.,6,8
JAIME, Exactly.,6,8
JAIME, We shouldn’t argue about politics.,6,8
BRIENNE," You’re a knight, Ser Jaime. I know there is honor in you. I’ve seen it myself.",6,8
JAIME, I’m a Lannister. Don’t ask me to betray my own house.,6,8
BRIENNE, I do no such thing. Take Riverrun without bloodshed. Ride south with your mission complete and your army intact.,6,8
JAIME, What do you propose?,6,8
BRIENNE, Allow me to enter Riverrun under a flag of truce. Let me try to persuade the Blackfish to give up the castle.,6,8
JAIME, Why would he abandon his ancestral home?,6,8
BRIENNE, Because you’ll allow him to lead the Tully forces safely north.,6,8
JAIME, Have you ever met the Blackfish?,6,8
BRIENNE, No.,6,8
JAIME, He’s even more stubborn than you are.,6,8
JAIME," All right. Try to talk some sense into the old goat. He won’t listen, but his men might. Not everybody wants to die for someone else’s home.",6,8
BRIENNE," I need your word. If I persuade him to abandon the castle, you’ll grant us safe passage north.",6,8
JAIME, You have my word. You have until nightfall.,6,8
BRIENNE, You gave it to me for a purpose. I’ve achieved that purpose.,6,8
JAIME, It’s yours. It will always be yours.,6,8
BRIENNE," one last thing, Ser Jaime.",6,8
JAIME," Yes, Lady Brienne?",6,8
BRIENNE," Should I fail to persuade the Blackfish to surrender, and if you attack the castle, honor compels me to fight for Sansa’s kin.",6,8

BRYNDEN," If you think I’m abandoning my family’s seat on the Kingslayer’s word of honor, you’re a bloody fool.",6,8
BRIENNE, Riverrun cannot stand against the Lannisters and the Freys.,6,8
BRYNDEN, We can stand longer than your one-handed friend thinks we can.,6,8
BRIENNE, He’s not my friend.,6,8
BRYNDEN, No?,6,8
BRYNDEN, Who gave you permission to cross the siege line and enter the castle? Who gave you that sword with the gold lion on the pommel?,6,8
BRIENNE," Ser Jaime kept his word to your niece Catelyn Stark. He sent me to find Sansa, to help her as Catelyn wanted. He gave me this sword to protect her. That is what I have done and I will continue to do until the day I die.",6,8
BRYNDEN, She’s exactly like her mother.,6,8
BRYNDEN, I don’t have enough men to help her take Winterfell.,6,8

CERSEI, To stand by my son.,6,8
KEVAN, Your place is in the gallery with the other ladies of the court.,6,8
TOMMEN," Lords and ladies, the Faith and the Crown are the two pillars that hold up this world. One collapses, so does the other. The Father judges us all. If you break his laws...you will be punished. After conferring with His Holiness the High Septon, we have determined that Loras Tyrell and Cersei lannister’s trial will be held in the Great Sept of Baelor on the first day of the Festival of the Mother.",6,8
TOMMEN," Furthermore, after much prayer and reflection, the Crown has decided that from this day forward, trial by combat will be forbidden throughout the Seven Kingdoms. The tradition is a brutish one, a scheme devised by corrupt rulers in order to avoid true judgment from the gods. Cersei Lannister and Loras Tyrell will stand trial before seven septons as it was in the earliest days of the Faith. Seven blessings to all.",6,8
CROWD, Seven blessings.,6,8
QYBURN, Your Grace...that old rumor you told me about. My little birds investigated.,6,8
CERSEI, And? Was it just a rumor or something more?,6,8
QYBURN, More. Much more.,6,8

TYRION," I am happy. You should both be as well. Not so long ago, this city was ready to devour itself.",6,8
TYRION, Now it’s like a man reborn.,6,8
MISSANDEI, I will be happy when our queen returns.,6,8
TYRION, Why don’t you drink? Why don’t either of you ever drink?,6,8
GREY WORM, Unsullied never drink.,6,8
TYRION, Why not?,6,8
GREY WORM, Rules.,6,8
TYRION, And who made these rules? Your former masters?,6,8
TYRION, Those miserable old shits didn’t want you to be human. Have a drink with me.,6,8
TYRION (to MISSANDEI), And you? What’s your excuse?,6,8
MISSANDEI, I have tried wine before. It made me feel funny.,6,8
TYRION, That’s how you know it’s working.,6,8
TYRION, Here’s to our queen. Anyone not drinking is disrespecting our queen.,6,8
TYRION," To Daenerys Stormborn, Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains, long may she reign.",6,8
GREY WORM & MISSANDEI, Long may she reign.,6,8
TYRION, Do you like it?,6,8
GREY WORM, Tastes like it has turned.,6,8
TYRION," Yes, yes. Fermentation. One day, after our queen has taken the Seven Kingdoms...I’d like to have my own vineyard. Make my own wine. The Imp’s Delight. Only my close friends could drink it.",6,8
TYRION," Tell me a joke, Missandei of Naath.",6,8
MISSANDEI, I do not know any jokes.,6,8
TYRION, Grey worm?,6,8
TYRION," Right. Three lords walk into a tavern- - a Stark, a Martell, and a Lannister. They order ale...",6,8
TYRION," ...but when the barkeep brings them over, each of them finds a fly in his cup. The Lannister, outraged, shoves the cup aside and demands another. The Martell plucks the fly out and swallows it whole. The Stark reaches into his cup, pulls out the fly and shouts, “Spit it out, you see shit. Spit it out.”",6,8
TYRION, It’s funnier in Westeros.,6,8
GREY WORM," The Starks and the lannisters, i thought these were enemies.",6,8
TYRION, Yes.,6,8
MISSANDEI," A joke is like a story, Torgo Nudho. Not a true story, necessarily.",6,8
TYRION," A story that’s supposed to make you laugh, ideally. Not at the moment, perhaps.",6,8
TYRION," Missandei, do you like the wine?",6,8
MISSANDEI, I do.,6,8
TYRION, Tell a joke.,6,8
MISSANDEI, Two translators are on a sinking ship.,6,8
MISSANDEI," The first says, “Do you know how to swim?” The second says, “No, but I can shout for help in 19 languages.”",6,8
GREY WORM, That is the worst joke I ever heard.,6,8
MISSANDEI, You don’t even know what a joke is.,6,8
GREY WORM, I am soldier all my life. You think I never hear joke?,6,8
TYRION, You lied to us.,6,8
GREY WORM, I make joke.,6,8
MISSANDEI, More jokes.,6,8
TYRION, I once walked into a brothel with a honeycomb and a jackass. The madam says- -,6,8

MISSANDEI, The Masters have come for their property.,6,8
JAIME, Lord Edmure.,6,8
JAIME, I apologize for the way the Freys treated you. A man of your birth deserved better. You have my word you’ll be properly fed and clothes from now on.,6,8
EDMURE, I have your word?,6,8
EDMURE," Oh, good. Good, that’s- - that’s a fine thing. My uncle will never surrender the castle, ser. Whatever game you’re playing.",6,8
JAIME," The Blackfish is an old man. A good death is all he can hope for. But you, you have a child now, I’ve heard. A son you sired on your wedding night. You’re a potent man.",6,8
EDMURE, A son I’ve never met born of a wife that I haven’t seen since our first night together.,6,8
JAIME," You should be with them both. I can arrange that, you realize? Comfortable rooms for you at Casterly Rock. A tutor for your boy, knights to train him to fight and to ride. And when he comes of age, he’ll have a keep of his own.",6,8
EDMURE, Do you imagine yourself a decent person? Is that it? After you’ve massacred my family. Kept me in a cell for years. Stolen our lands.,6,8
JAIME," I’ll remind you that our houses are at war. I’m sorry if this conflict has inconvenienced you, but rebelling against the Crown does have consequences.",6,8
EDMURE, Says the man who shoved his sword through his king’s back.,6,8
JAIME, Did I give you the impression that this was a negotiation? It’s not.,6,8
EDMURE, You understand. On some level you understand that you’re an evil man.,6,8
JAIME, I’ll leave the judgments to the gods.,6,8
EDMURE," Well, that is convenient for you. You’re a fine-looking fellow, aren’t you?",6,8
EDMURE," Your square jaw, your golden armor. Tell me, I want to know. I truly do. How do you live with yourself? All of us have to believe that we’re decent, don’t we? You have to sleep at night. How do you tell yourself that you’re decent after everything that you’ve done?",6,8
JAIME, I was your sister’s prisoner once. She hit me on the head with a rock if I remember correctly.,6,8
EDMURE, Yeah. She should have killed you.,6,8
JAIME," Perhaps, but she didn’t. Catelyn Stark hated me just like you hate me. But I didn’t hate her. I admired her. Far more than her husband or her son.",6,8
EDMURE, Do you think I care whom you admire and whom you don’t?,6,8
JAIME," No, I don’t, but I’m telling you anyway because you’re my prisoner. You don’t have a choice. The love she had for her children, I was a little awed by it. Reminded me of my sister.",6,8
EDMURE," Oh. Oh, I see. You’re a madman.",6,8
JAIME, I’m not here to trade insults. Your sister was a strong- -,6,8
EDMURE, Don’t talk about Cat!,6,8
JAIME, I’ll talk about whomever I want.,6,8
JAIME," She loved her children. I suppose all mothers do, but Catelyn and Cersei, there’s a fierceness you don’t often see.",6,8
JAIME, They’d do anything to protect their babies.,6,8
JAIME, Start a war. Burn cities to ash. Free their worst enemies. The things we do for love.,6,8
EDMURE, You didn’t come here to talk about our sisters.,6,8
JAIME," That’s exactly why I came here. I love Cersei. You can laugh at that if you want. You can sneer. It doesn’t matter. She needs me. And to get back to her, I have to take Riverrun. I’ll send for your baby boy.",6,8
JAIME," And I’ll launch him into Riverrun with a catapult. Because you don’t matter to me, Lord Edmure. Your son doesn’t matter to me. The people in the castle don’t matter to me. Only Cersei. And if I have to slaughter every Tully who ever lived to get back to her, that’s what I’ll do.",6,8

GUARD CAPTAIN, Who goes there?,6,8
EDMURE," Edmure Tully, son of Hoster Tully, and the rightful Lord of Riverrun. I demand entry.",6,8
BRYNDEN, Don’t let him in.,6,8
GUARD CAPTAIN, He’s the Lord of Riverrun. I have to obey his commands.,6,8
BRYNDEN," He’s been their captive ever since they murdered his king at the Red Wedding. Why do you think the people who murdered his king at the Red Wedding would decide to let him come home? Because it’s a trap, you idiot. Don’t let him in.",6,8
GUARD CAPTAIN," He’s my lord, my lord. I’ve sworn to serve the Lord of Riverrun and obey his commands.",6,8
BRYNDEN, You’re not obeying Edmure’s commands. You’re obeying the fucking Kinglsayer’s commands.,6,8
EDMURE (O.S.), I demand entry.,6,8
GUARD CAPTAIN, My lord has given an order.,6,8
BRYNDEN, WIth a knife to his throat. That is not a valid order.,6,8
GUARD CAPTAIN, Lower the drawbridge and open the gate for Lord Ed- -,6,8

BRYNDEN, You’ll serve Sansa far better than I ever could.,6,8

GREY WORM, You’re trying to tell me what the army should do. You do not know what the army should do.,6,8
TYRION," All right, what should the army do?",6,8
GREY WORM," We’ll not go to the beach. If we go to the beach, the Masters will take the pyramid. The pyramid is the only place in the city we can defend. We stay here.",6,8

SANDOR, Chasing them. You?,6,8
THOROS, Hanging them.,6,8
SANDOR, Any particular reason?,6,8
BERIC, They’re our men. Or they were. They attacked a nearby sept and murdered the villagers. Why do you want them?,6,8
SANDOR, Same reason. I was helping build it. They killed a friend of mine.,6,8
THOROS, You’ve got friends?,6,8
SANDOR, Not anymore. They’re mine.,6,8
BERIC, It’s the Brotherhood’s good name they’ve dragged through the dirt.,6,8

THOROS, We’re not butchers. We hang them.,6,8
SANDOR, hanging? All over in an instant. Where’s the punishment in that?,6,8
THOROS, They die.,6,8
SANDOR, We all bloody die.,6,8
SANDOR, Except this one here. I’ll only gut one of them.,6,8
BERIC, No.,6,8
SANDOR, I’ll chop off one hand.,6,8
BERIC, We gave you two of the three out of respect for your loss. That’s generous.,6,8
SANDOR, Bunch of nancies.,6,8
SANDOR, There was a time I would have killed all seven of you just to gut these three.,6,8
THOROS," You’re getting old, Clegane.",6,8

SANDOR, I tried joining. Didn’t work out for me.,6,8
THOROS," Clegane, we’re here for a reason. The Lord of Light is keeping Beric alive for a reason. He gave a failed, drunk priest the power to bring him back for a reason. We are part of something larger than ourselves.",6,8
SANDOR, Lots of horrible shit in this world gets done for something larger than ourselves.,6,8
BERIC, Cold winds are rising in the North.,6,8
SANDOR, And you’re going to go stop them?,6,8
BERIC, We need good men to help us.,6,8
SANDOR," Last time you saw me, you wanted to execute me.",6,8
BERIC, True enough. But the Lord of Light gave you the power to defeat me. Why?,6,8
SANDOR," I beat you because I’m better than you, Beric. I was better than you before you started yammering on about the Lord and I’m better than you now.",6,8
BERIC," Aye, you’re probably right. You’re a fighter. You were born a fighter. You walked away from the fight. How did that go? Good and bad, young and old, the things we’re fighting will destroy them all alike. You can still help a lot more than you’ve harmed Clegane, it’s not too late for you.",6,8

TYRION," Despite appearances, I think you’ll find the city’s on the rise.",6,9
TYRION, Perhaps we should take shelter.,6,9
DAENERYS, The city is on the rise?,6,9
TYRION, Meereen is strong. Commerce has returned to the markets. The people are behind you.,6,9
TYRION," Well, not all the people, of course. No ruler that ever lived had the support of all the people. But the rebirth of Meereen is the cause of this violence. The Masters cannot let Meereen succeed. Because if Meereen succeeds, a city without slavery, a city without Masters…",6,9
TYRION, ...it proves that no one needs a Master.,6,9
DAENERYS, Good. Shall we begin?,6,9
TYRION, Do we have a plan?,6,9
DAENERYS," I will crucify the Masters. I will set their fleets afire, kill every last one of their soldiers, and return their cities to the dirt. That is my plan.",6,9
DAENERYS, You don’t approve?,6,9
TYRION, You once told me you knew what your father was. Did you know his plans for King’s Landing when the Lannister armies were at his gates?,6,9
TYRION," Probably not. Well, he told my brother and Jaime told me. He had caches of wildfire hidden under the Red Keep, the Guildhalls, the Sept of Baelor, all the major thoroughfares. He would have burned every one of his citizens. The loyal ones and the trators. Every man, woman, and child. That’s why Jaime killed him.",6,9
DAENERYS, This is entirely different.,6,9
TYRION, You’re talking about destroying cities. It’s not entirely different. I’d like to suggest an alternate approach.,6,9

TYRION," We are here to discuss terms of surrender, not to trade insults.",6,9
YEZZAN, The terms are simple. You and your foreign friends will abandon the Great Pyramid and the city of Meereen. The Unsullied you stole from Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder. The translator you stole from Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder. The dragons beneath the Great Pyramid will be slaughtered.,6,9
DAENERYS," We obviously didn’t communicate clearly. We’re here to discuss your surrender, not mine.",6,9

MISSANDEI, Our queen insists that one of you must die as punishment for your crimes.,6,9
TYRION," It always seems a bit abstract, doesn’t it, other people dying?",6,9
RAZDAL, Him. He should die.,6,9

JON SNOW, You don’t have to be here.,6,9
SANSA," Yes, I do.",6,9
RAMSAY, My beloved wife. I’ve missed you terribly.,6,9
RAMSAY," Thank you for returning Lady Bolton safely. Now, dismount and kneel before me, surrender your army and proclaim me the true Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North. I will pardon you for deserting the Night’s Watch. I will pardon these treasonous lords for betraying my house. Come, bastard, you don’t have the men, you don’t have the horses, and you don’t have Winterfell. Why lead those pour souls into slaughter? There’s no need for a battle. Get off your hose and kneel. I’m a man of mercy.",6,9
JON SNOW, You’re right. There’s no need for a battle. Thousands of men don’t need to die. Only one of us. Let’s end this the old way. You against me.,6,9
RAMSAY," I keep hearing stories about you, bastard. The way people in the North talk about you, you’re the greatest swordsman who ever walked. Maybe you are that good. Maybe not. I don’t know if I’d beat you. But I know that my army will beat yours. I have 6,000 men. You have, what, half that? Not even?",6,9
JON SNOW," Aye, you have the numbers. Will your men want to fight for you when they hear you wouldn’t fight for them?",6,9
RAMSAY," He’s good. Very good. Tell me, will you let your little brother die because you’re too proud to surrender?",6,9
SANSA, How do we know you have him?,6,9
RAMSAY," Now, if you want to save —",6,9
SANSA," You’re going to die tomorrow, Lord Bolton. Sleep well.",6,9
RAMSAY (to JON SNOW)," She’s a fine woman, your sister. I look forward to having her back in my bed. And you’re all fine-looking men. My dogs are desperate to meet you. I haven’t fed them for seven days. They’re ravenous. I wonder which parts they’ll try first. Your eyes? Your balls? We’ll find out soon enough. In the morning, then, bastard.",6,9

DAVOS," That’s not his way. He knows the North is watching. If the other houses sense weakness on his part, they’ll stop fearing him. He can’t have that. Fear is his power.",6,9
JON SNOW," It’s his weakness, too. His mean don’t want to fight for him. They’re forced to fight for him. If they feel the tide turning...",6,9
TORMUND, It’s not his men that worry me. It’s his horses. I know what mounted knights can do to us.,6,9
TORMUND, You and Stannis cut through us like piss through snow.,6,9
JON SNOW," We’re digging trenches all along our flanks. They won’t be able to hit us the way that Stannis hit you, in a double envelopment.",6,9
JON SNOW, A pincer move.,6,9
JON SNOW, They won’t be able to hit us from the sides.,6,9
TORMUND, Good.,6,9
DAVOS," It’s crucial that we let them charge at us. They’ve got the numbers, we need the patience. If we let him buckle our center, he’ll pursue. Then we’ll have him surrounded on three sides.",6,9
TORMUND (to JON SNOW), Did you really think that cunt would fight you man to man?,6,9
JON SNOW, No. But I wanted to make him angry. I want him coming at us full tilt.,6,9
DAVOS, We should all get some sleep.,6,9
TORMUND," Rest, Jon Snow. We need you sharp tomorrow.",6,9
SANSA," So you’ve met the enemy, drawn up your battle plans.",6,9
JON SNOW," Aye, for what they’re worth.",6,9
SANSA," You’ve known him for the space of a single conversation, you and your trusted advisors, and you sit around and make your plans on how to defeat a man you don’t know. I lived with him. I know the way his mind works. I know how he likes to hurt people. Did it ever once occur to you that I might have some insight?",6,9
JON SNOW, You’re right.,6,9
SANSA, You think he’s going to fall into your trap. He won’t He’s the one who lays traps.,6,9
JON SNOW, He’s overconfident.,6,9
SANSA, He plays with people. He’s far better at it than you. He’s been doing it all his life.,6,9
JON SNOW," Aye, and what have I been doing all my life? Playing with broomsticks? I fought beyond the Wall against worse than Ramsay Bolton. I’ve defended the Wall from worse than Ramsay Bolton.",6,9
SANSA, You don’t know him.,6,9
JON SNOW," All right, tell me. What should we do? How do we get Rickon back?",6,9
SANSA," We’ll never get him back. Rickon is Ned Starks trueborn son, which makes him a greater threat to Ramsay than you, a bastard, or me, a girl. As long as he lives, Ramsay’s claim to Winterfell will be contested, which means he won’t live long.",6,9
JON SNOW, We can’t give up on our brother.,6,9
SANSA," Listen to me, please. He wants you to make a mistake.",6,9
JON SNOW, Of course he does. What should I do differently?,6,9
SANSA, I don’t know! I don’t know anything about battles! Just don’t do what he wants you to do.,6,9
JON SNOW," Aye, that’s good advice.",6,9
SANSA, You think that’s obvious?,6,9
JON SNOW," Well, it is a bit obvious.",6,9
SANSA," If you had asked for my advice earlier, I would have told you not to attack Winterfell until we have a larger force, or is that obvious, too?",6,9
JON SNOW, When will we have a larger force?! We’ve pleaded with every house that’ll have us! The Blackfish can’t help us! We’re lucky to have this many men!,6,9
SANSA, It’s not enough!,6,9
JON SNOW," Now, it’s not enough! It’s what we have! Battles have been won against greater odds.",6,9

DAVOS, You think there’s hope?,6,9
TORMUND," I’ve never seen these Bolton fuckers fight. And they’ve never seen the free folk fight, so, yes, there’s hope. You want to avenge your king, don’t you?",6,9
DAVOS, It wasn’t the Boltons defeated Stannis. It was Stannis himself. I loved the man. He lifted me up and made me something. But he had demons in his skull whispering foul things.,6,9
TORMUND, You saw these demons?,6,9
DAVOS, What?,6,9
DAVOS," No, it’s a manner of speaking. Not actual demons.",6,9
TORMUND," Oh. Well, you loved that cunt Stannis and I loved the man he burned. Mance didn’t have demons in his skull. He didn’t torch people or listen to some red witch. I believed in him. I thought he was the man to lead us through the Long Night. But I was wrong just like you.",6,9
DAVOS," Maybe that was our mistake, believing in kings.",6,9
TORMUND, Jon Snow’s not a king.,6,9
DAVOS," No, he’s not.",6,9
TORMUND, I need a good drink to help me sleep the night before a fight. You want some? I have a jug of sour goat’s milk stronger than any of that grape water you southern twats like sucking on.,6,9
DAVOS," No, thanks. It does sound delicious, but I better keep a clear head. I can never sleep the night before a battle.",6,9
TORMUND, So what do you do all night?,6,9
DAVOS, I walk. Think and walk. Think and walk until I’m far enough away from camp that no one can hear me shitting my guts out.,6,9

MELISANDRE, I serve the Lord of Light. I do what he commands.,6,9
JON SNOW, How do you know what he commands?,6,9
MELISANDRE," I interpret his signs as well as I can. If the Lord didn’t want me to bring you back, how did I bring you back? I have no power. Only what he gives me and he gave me you.",6,9
JON SNOW, Why?,6,9
MELISANDRE, I don’t know. Maybe you’re only needed for this small part of his plan and nothing else. Maybe he brought you here to die again.,6,9

CUT TO, STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS,6,9
TYRION (to THEON)," Last time we saw each other was at Winterfell, yes? You were making jokes about my height, I seem to recall. Everyone who makes a joke about a dwarf’s height thinks he’s the only person ever to make a joke about a dwarf’s height. “The height of nobility,” “a man of your stature,” “someone to look up to.” You’re all making the same five or six jokes.",6,9
THEON, It was a long time ago.,6,9
TYRION," It was. And how have things been going for you since then? Not so well, I gather. Can’t imagine you would have murdered the Stark boys if things had been going well.",6,9
THEON, I didn’t murder the Stark boys. But I did things that were just as bad or worse.,6,9
YARA, And he paid for them.,6,9
TYRION," Doesn’t seem like it. He’s still alive. It was complicated for you, I’m sure, growing up at Winterfell. Never quite knowing who you were. But then, we all live complicated lives, don’t we?",6,9
DAENERYS," You’ve brought us 100 ships from the Iron Fleet with men to sail them. In return, I expect you want me to support your claim to the throne of the Iron Islands?",6,9
THEON, Not my claim. Hers.,6,9
DAENERYS, And what’s wrong with you?,6,9
THEON, I’m not fit to rule.,6,9
TYRION, We can agree upon that at least.,6,9
DAENERYS, Has the Iron Islands ever had a queen before?,6,9
YARA, No more than Westeros.,6,9
THEON, Our Uncle Euron returned home after a long absence. He murdered our father and took the Salt Throne from yara. He would have murdered us if we had stayed.,6,9
DAENERYS, Lord Tyrion tells me your father was a terrible king.,6,9
YARA, You and I have that in common.,6,9
DAENERYS, We do. And both murdered by a usurper as well.,6,9
DAENERYS, Will their ships be enough?,6,9
TYRION," With the former Masters’ fleet, possibly. Barely. There are more than 100 ships in the Iron Fleet.",6,9
THEON, There are and Euron is building more. He’s going to offer them to you.,6,9
DAENERYS, So why shouldn’t I wait for him?,6,9
THEON, The Iron Fleet isn’t all he’s bringing. He also wants to give you --,6,9
YARA," His big cock, I think he said. Euron’s offer is also an offer of marriage, you see. You won’t get one without the other.",6,9
DAENERYS, And I imagine your offer is free of any marriage demands?,6,9
YARA," I never demand, but I’m up for anything, really.",6,9
THEON, He murdered our father and would have murdered us. He’ll murder you as soon as you have what he wants.,6,9
TYRION, The Seven Kingdoms.,6,9
THEON, All of them.,6,9
DAENERYS, And you don’t want the Seven Kingdoms?,6,9
THEON, Your ancestors defeated ours and took the Iron Islands. We ask you to give them back.,6,9
DAENERYS, And that’s all?,6,9
YARA, We’d like you to help us murder an uncle or two who don’t think a woman’s fit to rule.,6,9
DAENERYS, Reasonable.,6,9
TYRION, What if everyone starts demanding their independence?,6,9
DAENERYS," She’s not demanding, she’s asking. The others are free to ask as well. Our father were evil men, all of us here. They left the world worse than they found it. We’re not going to do that. We’re going to leave the world better than we found it.",6,9
DAENERYS," You will support my claim as queen of the Seven Kingdoms and respect the integrity of the Seven Kingdoms. No more reaving, roving, raiding, or raping.",6,9

HIGH SPARROW, Ser Loras Tyrell. Are you prepared to stand trial and profess your guilt or innocence before the Seven?,6,10
LORAS, There’ll be no need for a trial. I confess before the Seven and freely admit to my crimes.,6,10
HIGH SPARROW, To which crimes will you be confessing?,6,10
LORAS, All of them. I lay with other men including the traitor Renly Baratheon.,6,10
LORAS," I perjured myself before the gods. I am guilty of depravity… dishonesty, profligacy, and arrogance. I see that now. I humble myself before the Seven and accept whatever punishment the gods deem just.",6,10
HIGH SPARROW," The gods’ judgment is fierce, but also fair. The Warrior punishes those who believe themselves beyond the reach of justice. But the Mother shows her mercy to those who kneel before her.",6,10
LORAS, I take full responsibility for my many sins and unburden myself of my desires. My only remaining wish is to devote my life to the Seven. May I be a living example of their grace for others to witness.,6,10
HIGH SPARROW, You understand fully what this means?,6,10
LORAS, I do. I will abandon the Tyrell name and all that goes with it. I will renounce my lordship and my claims on Highgarden. I will never marry and I will never father children.,6,10
HIGH SPARROW, Brother Loras…,6,10
HIGH SPARROW, ...I ask you to dedicate your life to the seven gods.,6,10

CERSEI, Confess.,6,10
CERSEI," Confess. It felt good. Beating me, starving me, frightening me, humiliating me. You didn’t do it because you cared about my atonement. You did it because it felt good. I understand. I do things because they feel good. I drink because it feels good. I killed my husband because it felt good to be rid of him. I fuck my brother because it feels good to feel him inside me. I lie about fucking my brother… because it feels good to keep our son safe from hateful hypocrites. I killed your High Sparrow… and all his little sparrows… all his septons, all his septas, all his filthy soldiers, because it felt good to watch them burn. It felt good to imagine their shock and their pain. No thought has ever given me greater joy. Even confessing feels good under the right circumstances.",6,10
CERSEI, You’ve always been quiet.,6,10

WALDER, Edmure is back in a cell. Can’t go killing my son by law. It wouldn’t be right. Give the family a bad name.,6,10

JAIME," Have you done much fighting yourself, Lord Frey?",6,10
WALDER, I’m a bit old for all that.,6,10
JAIME," No, but back in your day.",6,10
WALDER," The purpose of fighting is defeating your enemies, isn’t it?",6,10
WALDER, I’ve defeated mine. Riverrun belonged to House Tully for a thousand years. Now it’s mine. What do you call that? Victory.,6,10
JAIME," Yes, you’re a great conqueror.",6,10
WALDER," Go on, mock me, boy. You think I mind? The Tullys mocked me for years. The Starks mocked me. Where are they now? You talk about war as if you’re an expert but the one battle I remember you fighting, you were captured by Robb Stark, the Young Wolf. But it doesn’t matter. Here we are now, two kingslayers. We know what it’s like to have them grovel to our faces and snigger behind our backs. We don’t mind, do we? Fear is a marvelous thing.",6,10
JAIME," They don’t fear the Freys, though. They fear the Lannisters. We gave you the Riverlands to hold the Riverlands. If we have to ride north and take them back for you every time you lose them, why do we need you?",6,10

DAVOS, Tell him what you did to her. Tell him!,6,10
MELISANDRE, We burned her at the stake.,6,10
DAVOS, Why?,6,10
MELISANDRE, The army was trapped. The horses were dying. It was the only way.,6,10
DAVOS, You burned a little girl alive!,6,10
MELISANDRE, I only do what my Lord commands!,6,10
DAVOS," If he commands you to burn children, your Lord is evil!",6,10
MELISANDRE, We are standing here because of him. Jon Snow is alive because the Lord willed it.,6,10
DAVOS, I loved that girl like she was my own. She was good. She was kind. And you killed her!,6,10
MELISANDRE, So did her father. So did her mother. Her own blood knew it was the only way.,6,10
DAVOS," The only way for what? They all died anyway! You told everyone Stannis was the one. You had him believing it, all of them fooled. And you lied.",6,10
MELISANDRE, I didn’t lie. I was wrong.,6,10
DAVOS," Aye, you were wrong. How many died because you were wrong?",6,10
DAVOS (to JON SNOW), I ask your leave to execute this woman for murder. She admits to the crime.,6,10
JON SNOW (to MELISANDRE), Do you have anything to say for yourself?,6,10
MELISANDRE," I’ve been ready to die for many years. If the Lord was done with me, so be it, but he’s not. You’ve seen the Night King, Jon Snow. You know the great war is still to come. You know the army of the dead will be upon us soon. And you know I can help you win that war.",6,10

SANSA, He did.,6,10
JON SNOW, And you trust him?,6,10
SANSA," Only a fool would trust Littlefinger. I should have told you about him, about the Knights of the Vale. I’m sorry.",6,10

ELLARIA, The Lannisters have declared war on House Tyrell. They have declared war on Dorne. We must be allies now if we wish to survive.,6,10
OLENNA, Cersei stole the future from me. She killed my son. She killed my grandson. She killed my granddaughter. Survival is not what I’m after now.,6,10
ELLARIA, You’re absolutely right. I chose the wrong words. It is not survival I offer. It is your heart’s desire.,6,10

DAARIO," New strategy? You want the Second Sons to attack from the west coast? If we take Casterly Rock, the Lannisters will have nowhere to run when you hit King’s Landing.",6,10
DAENERYS, You’re not going to Westeros. You’re staying here with the Second Sons. There’s finally peace in Meereen. You will keep the peace while the people choose their own leaders.,6,10
DAARIO," Fuck Meereen. Fuck the people. I’m here for you, not them.",6,10
DAENERYS," You promised me. “My sword is yours. My life is yours.” This is what I command. If I’m going to rule in Westeros, I’ll need to make alliances. The best way to make alliances is with marriage.",6,10
DAARIO, Who are you marrying this time?,6,10
DAENERYS, I don’t know. Maybe no one.,6,10
DAARIO, But you need to lure all the noble houses to the table? Are you a queen or fish bait?,6,10
DAENERYS, I can’t bring a lover to Westeros.,6,10
DAARIO, A king wouldn’t think twice about it.,6,10
DAENERYS, So that’s what you want? To be my mistress?,6,10
DAARIO, I’m not proud. I don’t care what perfumed aristocrat sits beside you in the throne room. I don’t want a crown. I want you.,6,10
DAARIO, I love you. And I make you happy. You know I do. Bring me with you. Let me fight for you.,6,10
DAENERYS, I can’t.,6,10
DAARIO, The dwarf told you to do this.,6,10
DAENERYS, No one tells me to do anything.,6,10
DAARIO, Clever fellow. Can’t argue with his logic. I’m no use to you over there.,6,10
DAENERYS, Don’t get angry.,6,10
DAARIO," I’m not angry. I’m full of self-pity. Who comes after you? Who can ever follow Daenerys Stormborn, the Mother of Dragons?",6,10
DAENERYS," A great number of women, I imagine. Specific orders will be left for you regarding the welfare of Meereen and the Bay of Dragons.",6,10
DAARIO, Bay of Dragons?,6,10

TYRION, How did he take it?,6,10
DAENERYS, No tears.,6,10
TYRION," I know it was hard for you. You turned away a man who truly loves you because he would have been a liability in the Seven Kingdoms. That’s the kind of self-sacrifice that makes for a good ruler, if it’s any consolation.",6,10
DAENERYS, It’s not.,6,10
TYRION," No, I suppose not. I’m terrible at consoling.",6,10
DAENERYS," Yes, you really are.",6,10
TYRION," All right, how about the fact that this is actually happening? You have your armies, you have your ships, you have your dragons. Everything you’ve ever wanted since you were old enough to want anything. It’s all yours for the taking. Are you afraid?",6,10
TYRION, Good. You’re in the great game now. And the great game’s terrifying. The only people who aren’t afraid of failure are madmen like your father.,6,10
DAENERYS, Do you know what frightens me? I said farewell to a man who loves me. A man I thought I cared for. And I felt nothing. Just impatient to get on with it.,6,10
TYRION, He wasn’t the first to love you and he won’t be the last.,6,10
DAENERYS," Well, you have completely failed to console me.",6,10
TYRION," For what it’s worth, I’ve been a cynic for as long as I can remember. Everyone’s always asking me to believe in things-- family, gods, kings, myself. It was often tempting until I saw where belief got people. So I said no, thank you to belief. And yet here I am.",6,10
TYRION," I believe in you. It’s embarrassing, really. I’d swear you my sword, but I don’t actually own a sword.",6,10
DAENERYS, It’s your counsel I need.,6,10
TYRION, It’s yours. Now and always.,6,10
DAENERYS," Good. I, um… I had something made for you. I’m not sure if it’s right.",6,10

HANDMAIDEN," But they’re already here, my lord.",6,10
HANDMAIDEN," Here, my lord.",6,10
HANDMAIDEN, They weren’t easy to carve. Especially Black Walder.,6,10

ARYA, My name is Arya Stark. I want you to know that. The last thing you’re ever going to see is a Stark smiling down at you as you die.,6,10
PETYR," Forgive me, my lady… if you’re at prayer.",6,10
SANSA," I’m done with all that. I came here every day when I was a girl. I prayed to be somewhere else. Back then I only ever thought about what I wanted, never about what I had.",6,10
SANSA, I was a stupid girl.,6,10
PETYR, You were a child.,6,10
SANSA, What do you want?,6,10
PETYR, I thought you knew what I wanted.,6,10
SANSA, I was wrong.,6,10
PETYR," No, you weren’t. Every time I’m faced with a decision, I close my eyes and see the same picture. Whenever I consider an action, I ask myself will this action help to make this picture a reality? Pull it out of my mind and into the world? And I only act if the answer is yes. A picture of me on the Iron Throne… and you by my side.",6,10
SANSA, It’s a pretty picture.,6,10
PETYR, News of this battle will spread quickly through the Seven Kingdoms. I’ve declared for House Stark for all to hear.,6,10
SANSA," You’ve declared for other houses before, Lord Baelish. It’s never stopped you from serving yourself.",6,10
PETYR," The past is gone for good. You can sit here mourning its departure or you can prepare for the future. You, my love, are the future of House Stark. Who should the North rally behind? A trueborn daughter of Ned and Catelyn Stark born here at Winterfell or a motherless bastard born in the south?",6,10
BENJEN, This is where I leave you.,6,10
MEERA, You’re not coming with us?,6,10

MEERA, Where will you go?,6,10
BENJEN, The great war is coming and I still fight for the living. I’ll do what I can… as long as I can.,6,10

TORMUND, We didn’t invade. We were invited.,6,10
VALE KNIGHT, Not by me.,6,10
JON SNOW," The free folk, the northerners, and the Knights of the Vale fought bravely, fought together, and we won. My father uses to say we find our true friends on the battlefield.",6,10
MAN," The Boltons are defeated. The war is over. Winter has come. If the maesters are right, it’ll be the coldest one in a thousand years. We should ride home and wait out the coming storms.",6,10
JON SNOW," The war is not over. And I promise you, friend, the true enemy won’t wait out the storm. He brings the storm.",6,10
LYANNA," Your son was butchered at the Red Wedding, Lord Manderly. But you refused the call. You swore allegiance to House Stark, Lord Glover, but in their hour of greatest need, you refused the call. And you, Lord Cerwyn, your father was skinned alive by Ramsay Bolton. Still you refuse the call. But House Mormont remembers. The North remembers. We know no king but the King in the North whose name is Stark. I don’t care if he’s a bastard. Ned Stark’s blood runs through his veins. He’s my king from this day until his last day.",6,10
MANDERLY," Lady Mormont speaks harshly and truly. My son died for Robb Stark, the Young Wolf. I didn’t think we’d find another king in my lifetime. I didn’t commit my men to your cause ‘cause I didn’t want more Manderlys dying for nothing. But I was wrong. Jon Snow avenged the Red Wedding. He is the White Wolf. The King in the North.",6,10
GLOVER, I did not fight beside you on the field and I will regret that until my dying day. A man can only admit when he was wrong and ask forgiveness.,6,10
JON SNOW," There’s nothing to forgive, my lord.",6,10
GLOVER, There will be more fights to come. House Glover will stand behind House Stark as we have for a thousands years. And I will stand behind Jon Snow… the King in the North!,6,10
GLOVER, The King in the North!,6,10
ALL, The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North!,6,10
JAIME, Come on.,6,10

QYBURN, Long may she reign.,6,10
ALL, Long may she reign.,6,10
WALDER FREY," You're wonder why I brought you all here. After all, we just had a feast. Since when does old Walder give us two feasts in a single fortnight?",7,1
WALDER FREY," Well, it's no good being lord of the Riverlands if you can't celebrate with your family. That's what I say!",7,1
WALDER FREY," I've gathered every Frey who means a damn thing so I can tell you my plans for this great house now that winter has come. But first, a toast! No more of that Dornish horse piss! This is the finest Arbor gold! Proper wine for proper heroes!",7,1
WALDERY FREY, Stand together!,7,1
ALL, Stand together!,7,1
WALDER, Not you. I'm not wasting good wine on a damn woman.,7,1
WALDER," Maybe I'm not the most pleasant man. I'll admit it. But I'm proud of you lot. You're my family, the men who helped me slaughter the Starks at the Red Wedding.",7,1
WALDER," Yes, yes. Cheer. Brave men, all of you. Butchered a woman pregnant with her babe. Cut the throat of a mother of five. Slaughtered your guests after inviting them into your home. But you didn't slaughter every one of the Starks.",7,1
WALDER," No, no, that was your mistake. You should have ripped them all out, root and stem.",7,1
WALDER, Leave one wolf alive and the sheep are never safe.,7,1
ARYA," When people ask you what happened here, tell them the North remembers. Tell them winter came for House Frey.",7,1

EDD, You wildlings?,7,1
MEERA," I'm Meera Reed, daughter of Howland Reed. This is Brandon Stark, son of Ned Stark.",7,1
EDD, How do I know that's true?,7,1
BRAN, You were at the Fist of the First Men. You were at Hardhome. You've seen the Army of the Dead. You've seen the Night King. He's coming for us. For all of us.,7,1
EDD," Okay, come on. Let's get them inside.",7,1
JON," I want every northern maester to scour their records for any mention of dragonglass. Dragonglass kills white walkers. It's more valuable to us now than gold. We need to find it, we need to mine it, we need to make weapons from it. Everyone aged 10 to 60 will drill daily with spears, pikes, bow and arrow.",7,1
ROBETT, It's about time we taught these boys of summer how to fight.,7,1
JON, Not just the boys.,7,1
JON, We can't defend the North if only half the population is fighting.,7,1
ROBETT, You expect me to put a spear in my granddaughter's hand?,7,1
LYANNA," I don't plan on knitting by the fire while men fight for me. I might be small, Lord Glover, and I might be a girl, but I am every bit as much a Northerner as you.",7,1
ROBETT," Indeed you are, my lady. No one has questioned--",7,1
LYANNA, And I don't need your permission to defend the North.,7,1
LYANNA," We'll begin training every man, woman, boy, and girl on Bear Island.",7,1
JON," While we're preparing for attack, we need to shore up our defenses. The only thing standing between us and the Army of the Dead is the Wall and the Wall hasn't been properly manned in centuries. I'm not the king of the Free Folk.",7,1
JON, But if we're going to survive this winter together...,7,1
TORMUND, You want us to man the castles for you?,7,1
JON, Last time we saw the Night King was at Hardhome. The closest castle to Hardhome is Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.,7,1
TORMUND, Then that's where I'll go. Looks like we're the Night's Watch now.,7,1
JON," If they breach the wall, the first two castles in their path are Last Hearth and Karhold.",7,1
YOHN, The Umbers and the Karstarks betrayed the North. Their castles should be torn down with not a stone left standing.,7,1
SANSA," The castles committed no crimes. And we need every fortress we have for the war to come. We should give the Last Hearth and Karhold to new families, loyal families who supported us against Ramsay.",7,1
ALL, Aye!,7,1
JON, The Umbers and the Karstarks have fought beside the Starks for centuries. They've kept faith for generation after generation.,7,1
SANSA, And then they broke faith.,7,1
JON, I'm not going to strip these families of their ancestral homes because of the crimes of a few reckless sons.,7,1
SANSA, So there's no punishment for treason and no reward for loyalty?,7,1
JON, The punishment for treason is death. Smalljon Umber died on the field of battle. Harald Karstark died on the field of battle.,7,1
SANSA, They died fighting for Ramsay. Give the castles to the families of the men who died fighting for you.,7,1
JON," When I was Lord Commander of the Night's Watch I executed men who betrayed me. I executed men who refused to follow orders. My father always said, ""The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword,"" and I have tried to live by those words. But I will not punish a son for his father's sins, and I will not take a family home away from a family it has belonged to for centuries. That is my decision, and my decision is final.",7,1
JON, Ned Umber.,7,1
JON, Alys Karstark.,7,1
JON," For centuries, our families fought side by side on the battlefield. I ask you to pledge your loyalty once again to House Stark, to serve as our bannermen and come to our air whenever called upon.",7,1
JON, Stand.,7,1
JON," Yesterday's wars don't matter anymore. The North needs to band together, all the living north. Will you stand beside me, Ned and Alys, now and always?",7,1
NED & ALYS, Now and always!,7,1
CUT TO, WINTERFELL - WALKWAY,7,1
JON," You are my sister, but I am king now.",7,1
SANSA, Will you start wearing a crown?,7,1
JON," When you question my decisions in front of the other lords and ladies, you undermine me.",7,1
SANSA, So I can't question your decisions anymore?,7,1
JON," Of course you can, but--",7,1
SANSA, Joffrey never let anyone question his authority. You think he was a good king?,7,1
JON, Do you think I'm Joffrey?,7,1
SANSA, You're as far from Joffrey as anyone I've ever met.,7,1
JON, Thank you.,7,1
SANSA," You're good at this, you know.",7,1
JON, At what?,7,1
SANSA, At ruling.,7,1
JON, No.,7,1
SANSA," You are. You are. They respect you, they really do, but you have to--",7,1
SANSA, Why are you laughing?,7,1
JON," What did father used to say? Everything before the word ""but"" is horse shit.",7,1
SANSA, He never said that to me.,7,1
JON," No. No, he never cursed in front of his girls.",7,1
SANSA," Because he was trying to protect us. He never wanted us to see how dirty the world really is, but Father couldn't protect me and neither can you. Stop trying.",7,1
JON," All right, I'll stop trying to protect you and you stop trying to undermine me.",7,1
SANSA, I'm not trying to undermine you.,7,1
SANSA," You have to be smarter than Father. You need to be smarter than Robb. I loved them, I miss them, but they made stupid mistakes, and they both lost their heads for it.",7,1
JON, And how should I be smarter? By listening to you?,7,1
SANSA, Would that be so terrible?,7,1
WOLKAN," A raven from King's Landing, Your Grace.",7,1
JON," ""Cersei of House Lannister, First of Her Name, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms--""",7,1
SANSA, What does she want?,7,1
JON, Come to King's Landing. Bend the knee or suffer the fate of all traitors.,7,1
SANSA," You've been so consumed with the enemy to the north, you've forgotten about the one to the south.",7,1
JON," I'm consumed with the Night King because I've seen him. And believe me, you'd think of little else if you had, too.",7,1
SANSA, We still have a wall between us and the Night King. Theres nothing between us and Cersei.,7,1
JON, There's a thousand miles between us and Cersei. Winter is here. The Lannisters are a southern army. They've never ranged this far north.,7,1
SANSA," You're the military man, but I know her. If you're her enemy, she'll never stop until she's destroyed you. Everyone who's ever crossed her, she's found a way to murder.",7,1
JON, You almost sound as if you admire her.,7,1
SANSA, I learned a great deal from her.,7,1
JAIME, What is this?,7,1
CERSEI," Its what we've been waiting for our whole lives. It's what Father trained us for, whether he knew it or not.",7,1
JAIME," He knew it. Made me memorize every damn city, town, lake, forest, and mountain.",7,1
CERSEI," It's ours now, we just have to take it.",7,1
CERSEI, You've been quiet since you came home. Are you angry with me?,7,1
JAIME," No, not angry.",7,1
CERSEI, Are you afraid of me?,7,1
JAIME, Should I be?,7,1
CERSEI," Daenerys Targaryen has chosen Tyrion to be her Hand. Right now, they're sailing across the Narrow Sea, hoping to take back her father's throne. Our little brother, the one you love so much, the one you set free, the one who murdered our father and our first-born son, now he stands beside our enemies and gives them counsel. He's out there somewhere at the head of an armada. Where will they land?",7,1
JAIME, Dragonstone.,7,1
JAIME," They have deep-water ports for the ships. Stannis left the castle unoccupied, and that's where she was born.",7,1
CERSEI, Enemies to the east.,7,1
CERSEI, Enemies to the south--Ellaria Sand and her brood of bitches.,7,1
CERSEI," Enemies to the west--Olenna, the old cunt. Another traitor.",7,1
CERSEI, Enemies to the north. Ned Stark's bastard has been named King in the North and that murdering whore Sansa stands beside him. Enemies everywhere. We're surrounded by traitors. You're in command of the Lannister army now. How do we proceed?,7,1
JAIME," Winter is here. We can't win a war if we can't feed our men and our horses. The Tyrells have the grain, the Tyrells have the livestock.",7,1
CERSEI, Will the Tyrell bannermen stand alongside a Dothraki horde and Unsullied slave soldiers?,7,1
JAIME," If they think Daenerys will win. No one wants to fight on the losing side. Right now, we look like the losing side.",7,1
CERSEI, I'm the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.,7,1
JAIME," Three kingdoms, at best. I'm not sure you understand how much danger we're in.",7,1
CERSEI, I understand we're in a war for survival. I understand whoever loses dies. I understand whoever wins could launch a dynasty that lasts a thousand years.,7,1
JAIME, A dynasty for whom? Our children are dead. We're the last of us.,7,1
CERSEI," A dynasty for us, then.",7,1
JAIME, We never talked about Tommen.,7,1
CERSEI, There's nothing to say.,7,1
JAIME, Our baby boy killed himself.,7,1
CERSEI," He betrayed me. He betrayed us both. Should we spend our days mourning the dead--mother, father, and all our children?",7,1
JAIME, Cersei--,7,1
CERSEI," I loved them. I did. But they're ashes now and we're still flesh and blood. We're the last Lannisters, the last ones who count.",7,1
JAIME, Even Lannisters can't survive without allies. Where are our allies now? You saw what happened to Walder Frey and his family.,7,1
CERSEI, I heard. How could we ever trust a man like that?,7,1
JAIME," We couldn't. He was a useless, old coward, but the Freys supported us. Now they're all dead. Whoever killed them is no friend of ours. We need allies. Stronger, better allies. We can't win this war alone.",7,1
CERSEI, You think I listened to Father for 40 years and learned nothing?,7,1
CUT TO, KING'S LANDING - BLACKWATER BAY,7,1
JAIME, The Greyjoys? You invited the Greyjoys to King's Landing?,7,1
CERSEI, Not all of them.,7,1
JAIME," Well, it looks like all of them.",7,1
CERSEI," I invited Euron Greyjoy, the new King of the Iron Islands. You said yourself we needed stronger, better allies. There you are.",7,1
JAIME, How are they better allies? How are they different from the Freys? They both broke their promises and murdered their former friends as soon as it suited them.,7,1
CERSEI," So does everyone when it suits them. Unlike the Freys, they have ships. And they're good at killing.",7,1
JAIME," They're not good at anything. I know the Ironborn. They're bitter, angry little people. All they know how to do is steal things they can't build or grow themselves.",7,1
CERSEI, Euron Greyjoy didn't come here for that.,7,1
JAIME," Oh, what did he come here for, then?",7,1
CERSEI, A queen.,7,1
CUT TO, KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP GREAT HALL,7,1
EURON," The moment I was chosen Lord of the Iron Islands, they turned on me. Their own uncle. They stole my best ships and ran. Sailed the right across the world and gave them to the Dragon Queen so she could bring her armies here to attack you.",7,1
EURON," It's nothing compares to the treason you suffered at the hands of a family members, from what I hear. But still, it bothers me. Murdering them would make me feel a lot better. And since it appears that all our treasonous family members are fighting for the same side, I thought we rightful monarchs could murder them together.",7,1
JAIME," You're not a rightful monarch, though, are you?",7,1
JAIME," The Greyjoys rebelled agains the throne for the right to be monarchs, but as I recall, you were soundly defeated. Come to mention it, weren't you the one who started that rebellion by sailing to Casterly Rock and burning the Lannister fleet? You certainly caught us there. Very smart move on your part. Of course, we all made it to the Iron Islands anyway. I was there.",7,1
EURON," I remember very well. I saw you. I heard so much talk. The best in the world. No one can stop him. I didn't believe it, to be honesty. But I must say, when you rushed through the breach and started cutting people down...it was glorious. Like a dance.",7,1
JAIME, The people I was cutting down were your own kin.,7,1
EURON, The place was getting crowded. I enjoyed watching it. I truly did.,7,1
JAIME, And I enjoyed killing Greyjoys.,7,1
EURON," A good thing for me. If you hadn't crushed us, I wouldn't have gone into exile. If I hadn't done that, I wouldn't be the greatest captain on the 14 seas.",7,1
CERSEI, If not the most humble.,7,1
EURON," You're not humble. You're the queen of a great nation. You don't care about the Iron Islands. They're nothing but rocks and bird shit and--and a lot of very unattractive people. The Iron Fleet, on the other hand, that's something else entirely. It's the greatest armada Westeros has ever seen. With the Iron Fleet, you own the seas. You can defeat the invaders of the east and the pretenders of the north and south.",7,1
CERSEI, What do you want in return?,7,1
EURON," Ever since I was a little boy, I wanted to grow up and mary the most beautiful woman in the world. So here I am, with a thousand ships and two good hands.",7,1
CERSEI, I decline your proposal.,7,1
EURON, Why?,7,1
CERSEI, You're not trustworthy. You've broken promises to allies before and murdered them at the nearest opportunity. You murdered your own brother.,7,1
EURON, You should try it. Feels wonderful.,7,1
EURON," I don't expect you to trust me outright. You need proof of my honest intentions. In my experience, the surest way to a woman's heart is with a gift. A priceless gift. I won't return to King's Landing until I have that for you.",7,1

MARWYN, What's the weight?,7,1
SAM," Um, 147.",7,1
SAM, I was wondering if you had considered my proposition.,7,1
MARWYN, I don't remember your proposition.,7,1
SAM," I asked you if, in light of what I've seen in the North, if I could have access to the restricted area of the library.",7,1
MARWYN, That area is reserved for maesters. Are you a maester?,7,1
SAM, No.,7,1
MARWYN," Not a very strong proposition, is it?",7,1
SAM," Archmaester, with respect, I've seen them--the Army of the Dead. The white walkers. W was sent here to learn how to defeat them, but everyone in the Citadel, those who will even talk to me, they all doubt the walkers ever existed in the first place.",7,1
MARWYN, Everyone in the Citadel doubts everything. It's their job. But the tales of the Long Night can't be pure fabrication. Too many similarities from unconnected sources.,7,1
SAM, Sources in the restricted area?,7,1
MARWYN, The very same. And the simplest explanation for your grating obsession with the white walkers is that you're telling the truth and that you saw what you say you saw.,7,1
SAM," So, you believe me.",7,1
MARWYN, I do. You'll finish weighing that heart?,7,1
SAM, That makes you the only person south of the Twins who does.,7,1
MARWYN," We're not lie the people south of the Twins. And we're not like the people north of the Twins. In the Citadel, we lead different lives for different reasons. We are this world's memory, Samwell Tarly. Without us, men would be little better than dogs. Don't remember any meal but the last, can't see forward to any but the next. And every time you leave the house and shut the door, they howl like you're gone forever. When Robert's Rebellion was raging, people that the end was near. The end of the Targaryen dynasty. ""How will we survive?"" When Aegon Targaryen turned his eye westward and flew his dragons to Blackwater Rush--""The end is near! How will we survive?"" And thousands of year before that, during the Long Night, we can forgive them for thinking it truly was the end. But it wasn't. None of it was. The Wall has stood through it all. And every winter that ever came has ended.",7,1

BERIC, I don't know what He wants from me. I only know that He wants me alive.,7,1
SANDOR," If he's so all-powerful, why doesn't he just tell you what the fuck he wants?",7,1
THOROS, Clegane.,7,1
THOROS, Come over here. Don't worry. The fire won't bite. I want to show you something.,7,1
SANDOR, It's my fucking luck I end up with a band of fire worshippers.,7,1
BERIC, Aye. Almost seems like divine justice.,7,1
SANDOR," There's no divine justice, you dumb cunt. If there was, you'd be dead...and that girl would be alive.",7,1
SANDOR, What do you want?,7,1
THOROS, Look into the flames.,7,1
SANDOR, I don't want to look in the damn flames.,7,1
THOROS, You saw me bring him back from the dead after you cut him down. Don't you want to know what gave me the power?,7,1
SANDOR, I keep asking and no one wants to tell me.,7,1
THOROS, We can't tell you. Only the fire can tell you.,7,1
THOROS, What do you see?,7,1
SANDOR, Logs burning.,7,1
THOROS, Keep looking. What do you see?,7,1
SANDOR, Ice. A wall of ice. The Wall.,7,1
THOROS, What else?,7,1
SANDOR, It's where the Wall meets the sea. There's a castle there.,7,1
SANDOR, There's a mountain. Looks like an arrowhead. The dead are marching past.,7,1
SANDOR, Thousands of them.,7,1

GILLY," ""Legends of the Long Night.""",7,1
SAM, The Targaryens used dragonglass to decorate their weapons without even knowing what the First Men used it for.,7,1
GILLY, What is it?,7,1
SAM, It's a map of Dragonstone. The Targaryens built their first stronghold there when they invaded Westeros.,7,1
GILLY, That's dragonglass?,7,1

TYRION," On a night like this, you came into the world.",7,2
VARYS, I remember that storm. All the dogs in King's Landing howled through the night.,7,2
DAENERYS, I wish I could remember it.,7,2
DAENERYS, I always thought this would be a homecoming. It doesn't feel like home.,7,2
TYRION, We won't stay on Dragonstone for long.,7,2
DAENERYS, Good.,7,2
DAENERYS, Not so many lions.,7,2
VARYS," Cersei controls fewer than half the Seven Kingdoms. The lord of Westeros despise her. Even before your arrival, they plotted against her. Now...",7,2
DAENERYS, They cry out for their true queen? They drink secret toasts to my health?,7,2
DAENERYS," People used to tell my brother that sort of thing, and he was stupid enough to believe them.",7,2
DAENERYS," If Viserys had three dragons and an army at his back, he'd have invaded King's Landing already.",7,2
TYRION, Conquering Westeros would be easy for you. But you're not here to be queen of the ashes.,7,2
DAENERYS, No.,7,2
TYRION," We can take the Seven Kingdoms without turning it into a slaughterhouse. If the great houses support your claim against Cersei, the game is won. With the Tyrell army and the Dornish on our side, we have powerful allies in the south.",7,2
DAENERYS, I never properly thanked you for that.,7,2
VARYS," They joined our side, my queen, because they believe in you.",7,2
DAENERYS," You served my father, didn't you, Lord Varys?",7,2
VARYS, I did.,7,2
DAENERYS, And then you served the man who overthrew him?,7,2
VARYS," I had a choice, Your Grace--serve Robert Baratheon or face the headman's axe.",7,2
DAENERYS, But you didn't serve him long. You turned against him.,7,2
VARYS," Robert was an improvement on your father, to be sure. There have been few rulers in history as cruel as the Mad King. Robert was neither mad nor cruel. He simply had no interest in being king.",7,2
DAENERYS, So you took it upon yourself to find a better one.,7,2
TYRION," Your Grace, when I was ready to drink myself into a small coffin, Lord Varys told me about a queen in the east who--",7,2
DAENERYS (to VARYS)," Before I came to power, you favored my brother. All your spies, your little birds, did they tell you Viserys was cruel, stupid, and weak? Would those qualities have made for a good king in your learned opinion?",7,2
VARYS," Until your marriage to Khal Drogo, Your Grace, I knew nothing about you, save your existence and that you were said to be beautiful.",7,2
DAENERYS, So you and your friends traded me like a prized horse to the Dothraki.,7,2
VARYS, Which you turned to your advantage.,7,2
DAENERYS, Who gave the order to kill me?,7,2
VARYS, King Robert.,7,2
DAENERYS, Who hired the assassins?,7,2
DAENERYS, Who sent word to Essos to murder Daenerys Targaryen?,7,2
VARYS," Your Grace, I did what had to be done to--",7,2
DAENERYS, To keep yourself alive.,7,2
TYRION, Lord Varys has proven himself a loyal servant.,7,2
DAENERYS," Proven himself loyal? Quite the opposite. If he dislikes one monarch, he conspires to crown the next one. What king of a servant is that?",7,2
VARYS," The kind the realm needs. Incompetence should not be rewarded with blind loyalty. As long as I have my eyes, I'll use them. I wasn't born into a great house. I came from nothing. I was sold as a slave and carved up as an offering. When I was a child, I lived in alleys, gutters, abandoned houses. You wish to know where my true loyalties lie? Not with any king or queen, but with the people. The people who suffer under despots and prosper under just rule. The people whose hearts you aim to win. If you demand blind allegiance, I respect your wishes. Grey Worm can behead me or your dragons can devour me. But if you let me live, I will serve you well. I will dedicate myself to seeing you on the Iron Throne because I choose you. Because I know the people have no better chance than you.",7,2
DAENERYS," Swear this to me, Varys. If you ever think I'm failing the people, you won't conspire behind my back. You'll look me in the eye as you have done today, and you'll tell me how I'm failing them.",7,2
VARYS," I swear it, my queen.",7,2
DAENERYS," And I swear this--if you ever betray me, I'll burn you alive.",7,2
VARYS, I would expect nothing less from the Mother of Dragons.,7,2
GREY WORM," Forgive me, my queen. A red priestess from As'shai has come to see you.",7,2
CUT TO, DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM,7,2
MELISANDRE," Queen Daeneys, I was a slave once, bought and sold, scourged and branded. It is an honor to meet the Breaker of Chains.",7,2
DAENERYS, The Red Priests helped bring peace to Meereen. You are very welcome here. What is your name?,7,2
MELISANDRE, I am called Melisandre.,7,2
VARYS," She once served another who wanted the Iron Throne. It didn't end well for Stannis Baratheon, did it?",7,2
MELISANDRE," No, it didn't.",7,2
DAENERYS, You chose an auspicious day to arrive at Dragonstone.,7,2
DAENERYS, We've just decided to pardon those who served the wrong king.,7,2
DAENERYS," The Lord of Light doesn't have many followers in Westeros, does he?",7,2
MELISDANDRE, Not yet. But even those who don't worship the Lord can serve his cause.,7,2
DAENERYS, What does your Lord expect from me?,7,2
MELISANDRE, The Long Night is coming. Only the prince who was promised can bring the dawn.,7,2
DAENERYS, The prince who was promised will bring the dawn. I'm afraid I'm not a prince.,7,2
MISSANDEI," Your Grace, forgive me, but your translation is not quite accurate. That noun has no gender in High Valyrian, so the proper translation for that prophecy would be the prince or princess who was promised will bring the dawn.",7,2
TYRION," Doesn't really roll off the tongue, does it?",7,2
DAENERYS," No, but I like it better.",7,2
DAENERYS, And you believe this prophecy refers to me?,7,2
MELISANDRE," Prophecies are dangerous things. I believe you have a roll to play, as does another. The King in the North, Jon Snow.",7,2
TYRION, Jon Snow? Ned Stark's bastard?,7,2
DAENERYS, You know him?,7,2
TYRION, I traveled with him to the Wall when he joined the Night's Watch.,7,2
VARYS," And why do you think the Lord of Light singled out this Jon Snow aside from the visions you've seen in the flames, that is?",7,2
MELISANDRE, As Lord Commander of the Night's Watch he allowed the Wildlings south of the Wall to protect them from great danger. As King in the North he has united those Wildlings with the northern houses so together they may face their common enemy.,7,2
DAENERYS, He sounds like quite a man.,7,2
MELISANDRE," Summon Jon Snow. Let him stand before you and tell you things that have happened to him, the things that he has seen with his own eyes.",7,2
TYRION," I can't speak to prophecies or visions in the flames, but I like Jon Snow and I trusted him, and I am an excellent judge of character.",7,2
TYRION," If he does rule the north, he would make a valuable ally. The Lannisters executed his father and conspired to murder his brother. Jon Snow has even more reason to hate Cersei than you do.",7,2
DAENERYS, Very well. Send a raven north. Tell Jon Snow that his Queen invites him to come to Drangonstone...and bend the knee.,7,2
CUT TO, WINTERFELL - COURTYARD,7,2
SANSA, Do you think it's really Tyrion? It could be someone trying to lure you into a trap.,7,2
JON, Read the last bit.,7,2
SANSA," ""All dwarfs are bastards in their father's eyes."" What does that mean?",7,2
JON, It's something he said to me the first night we met. You know him better than any of us. What do you think?,7,2
SANSA," Tyrion is not like the other Lannisters. He was always kind to me, but it's too great a risk. ""The Seven Kingdoms will bleed as long as Cersei sits on the Iron Throne. Join us. Together we can end her tyranny.""",7,2
DAVOS," Sounds like a charmer. Of course, the casual mention of a Dothraki horde, a legion of Unsullied and three dragons, a bit less charming.",7,2
JON, What?,7,2
DAVOS," Fire kills Whites, you told me. What breathes fire?",7,2
SANSA, You're not suggesting Jon meet with her?,7,2
DAVOS," No, too dangerous.",7,2
JON, But?,7,2
DAVOS," But if the Army of the Dead makes it passed the Wall, do we have enough men to fight them?",7,2
CUT TO, RED KEEP - THRONEROOM,7,2
CERSEI," If the Mad King's daughter takes the Iron Throne, she will destroy the Realm as we know it. Some of you are bannermen of House Tyrell. But House Tyrell is in open rebellion against the Crown. With their help the Mad King's daughter has ferried an army of savages to our shores. Mindless Unsullied soldiers who will destroy your castles and your holdfasts. Dothraki heathens who will burn your villages to the ground, rape and enslave your women, and butcher your children without a second thought. This is how Olenna Tyrell rewards centuries of service and loyalty.",7,2
CERSEI," You all remember the Mad King. You remember the horrors he inflicted upon his people. His daughter is no different. In Essos her brutality is already legendary. She crucified hundreds of noblemen in Slaver's Bay. And when she grew bored of that, she fed them to her dragons.",7,2
CERSEI," It is my solemn duty to protect the people, and I will but I need your help, My Lords. We must stand together, all of us, if we hope to stop her.",7,2
RANDYLL," She has three full-grown dragons, Your Grace. The same as Aegon when he conquered the Seven Kingdoms. How do you propose to stop them?",7,2
QYBURN," We are currently at work on a solution, My Lord.",7,2

DICKON, Dickon.,7,2
JAIME, That's it.,7,2
JAIME, Thank you for coming. The other lords of the Reach look to you for guidance now more than ever. They might not have come if you hadn't.,7,2
RANDYLL," If my queen summons me, I answer the call. And I've heard what she does to those that defy her.",7,2
JAIME, Do you ride for Hornhill today?,7,2
RANDYLL, I have an army to mobilize. It won't be long until the fighting starts.,7,2
JAIME, And what side will you be fighting for? You were the only man to defeat Robert Baratheon in battle. Not even Rhaegar Targaryen could --,7,2
RANDYLL," It's a long ride back to the reach, Ser Jaime. How may I serve?",7,2
JAIME, I want you to be my ranking general in the wars to come. I want you to swear allegiance to Cersei and I want you to help her destroy her enemies. All of her enemies.,7,2
RANDYLL, Including Olenna Tyrell? I'm a Tarley. That name means something. We're not oath breakers. We're not schemers. We don't stab our rivals in the back or cut their throats at weddings. I swore an oath to House Tyrell.,7,2
JAIME," You swore an oath to the Crown as well, Lord Tarley.",7,2
RANDYLL, I've known Olenna since I was a child.,7,2
JAIME," She was a great woman, once. Now she's broken. She wants revenge so badly she brought the Dothraki to our shores. The Dothraki in Westeros for the first time in history. I know you don't like my sister, but you have to make a choice. Do you fight with us or with the foreign savages and eunuchs?",7,2
JAIME, When the war is won the queen will need a new warden of the south. I can think of no better man than Randyll Tarley.,7,2

QYBURN, Curious that King Robert did not have them destroyed.,7,2
CERSEI, They were his trophies. He couldn't keep them around. They would have made him look small. Sometimes he would come down here and look at them. I believe he brought his whores on occasion.,7,2

ELLARIA, She was a Lannister. There are no innocent Lannisters. My greatest regret is that Oberyn died fighting for you.,7,2
DAENERYS, That's enough. Tyrion is the Hand of the Queen. You will treat him with respect.,7,2
DAENERYS, I am not here to be queen of the ashes.,7,2
OLENNA," That's very nice to hear. Of course, I can't remember a queen who was better loved than my grand daughter. The common people loved her, the nobles loved her. And what is left of her now? Ashes. Commoners, nobles, they're all just children really. They won't obey you unless they fear you.",7,2
DAENERYS," I'm grateful to you, Lady Olenna, for your council. I'm grateful to all of you. But you have chosen to follow me. I will not attack King's Landing. We will not attack King's Landing.",7,2
OLEANNA, Then how do you mean to take the Iron Throne? By asking nicely?,7,2
DAENERYS, We will lay siege to the capital surrounding the city on all sides. Cersei will have the Iron Throne but no food for her army or the people.,7,2
TYRION, But we won't use Dothraki and Unsullied.,7,2
TYRION," Cersei will try to rally the lords of Westeros by appealing to their loyalty, their love for their country. If we besiege the city with foreigners, we prove her point. Our army should be Westerosi.",7,2
ELLIA, And I suppose we're providing the Westerosi?,7,2
TYRION, You are.,7,2
TYRION, Lady Greyjoy will escort you home to Sunspear and her Iron Fleet will ferry the Dornish army back up to King's Landing.,7,2
TYRION, The Dornish will lay siege to the capital alongside the Tyrell army. Two great kingdoms united against Cersei.,7,2
OLENNA," So, your master plan is to use our armies? Forgive me for asking, but why did you bother to bring your own?",7,2
TYRION, The unsullied will have another objective. For decades House Lannister has been the true power in Westeros. And the seat of that power is Casterly Rock. Grey Worm and the Unsullied will sail for the Rock and take it.,7,2
DAENERYS, Do I have your support?,7,2
YARA, You have mine.,7,2
ELLIA," Dorne is with you, Your Grace.",7,2
DAENERYS," Thank you all. Lady Olenna, may I speak with you alone?",7,2
DAENERYS, I realize you're here out of hatred for Cersei and not love for me. But I swear to you she will pay for what she's done and we will bring peace back to Westeros.,7,2
OLENNA," Peace. Do you think that's what we had under your father or his father or his? Peace never lasts, my dear. Would you take a bit of advice from an old woman?",7,2
OLENNA," He's a clever man, your Hand. I've known a great many clever men. I've outlived them all. Do you know why? I ignored them. The lords of Westeros are sheep. Are you a sheep? No. You're a dragon. Be a dragon.",7,2

MISSANDEI, I don't.,7,2
GREY WORM, You are my weakness.,7,2
MISSANDEI, That's what I am? Your weakness?,7,2
GREY WORM," When Unsullied are young their masters learn their fears. One boy is scared of dogs. One boy hates high places. One is frightened of the ocean. They make the boy sleep with dogs or climb a cliff. They throw him in the water. If he learns to swim, good. If he drowns, good. Either way, strong Unsullied. But I had no fears. I was never the biggest, never the strongest, but I was bravest always.",7,2

MARWYN, This is your moment. Use it wisely.,7,2

JON, I received this a few days ago from Dragonstone. It was sent to me by Tyrion Lannister.,7,2
JON," He's now Hand of the Queen to Daenerys Targaryen. She intends to take the Iron Throne from Cersei Lannister. She has a powerful army at her back and if this message is to be believed, three dragons.",7,2
JON, Lord Tyrion has invited me to Dragonstone to meet with Daenerys and I'm going to accept.,7,2
JON," We need this Dragonglass, My Lords. We know that Dragonglass can destroy both White Walkers and their army. We need to mine it and turn it into weapons.",7,2
JON," But more importantly, we need allies. The Night King's army grows larger by the day. We can't defeat them on our own. We don't have the numbers. Daenerys has her own army and she has dragon fire. I need to try and persuade her to fight with us. Ser Davos and I will ride for White Harbor tomorrow, then sail for Dragonstone.",7,2
SANSA, Have you forgotten what happened to our grandfather? The Mad King invited him to King's Landing and roasted him alive.,7,2
JON, I know that.,7,2
SANSA," She is here to reclaim the Iron Throne and the Seven Kingdoms. The north is one of those seven kingdoms. This isn't an invitation, it's a trap.",7,2
JON," It could be, but I don't believe Tyrion would do that. You know him. He's a good man.",7,2
YOHN ROYCE," Your Grace, with respect I must agree with Lady Sansa. I remember the Mad King all too well. A Targaryen cannot be trusted, nor can a Lannister.",7,2
ROBETT GLOVER," We called your brother king, and then he rode south and lost his kingdom.",7,2
LYANNA MORMONT," Winter is here, Your Grace. We need the King in the North in the north.",7,2
JON," You all crowned me your king. I never wanted it, I never asked for it, but I accepted it because the north is my home. It's part of me and I will never stop fighting for it, no matter the odds. But the odds are against us. None of you have seen the Army of the Dead. None of you. We can never hope to defeat them alone. We need allies, powerful allies. I know it's a risk. But I have to take it.",7,2
SANSA, Then send an emissary. Don't go yourself.,7,2
JON, Daenerys is a queen. Only a king can convince her to help us. It has to be me.,7,2
SANSA, You're abandoning your people. Your abandoning your home.,7,2
JON, I'm leaving both in good hands.,7,2
SANSA, Whose?,7,2
JON," Yours. You are my sister. You are the only Stark in Winterfell. Until I return, the north is yours.",7,2
CUT TO, WINTERFELL - THE CRYPT,7,2
BAELISH, I delivered his bones myself. I presented them to Lady Catlyn as a gesture of goodwill from Tyrion Lannister. It seems like a lifetime ago. Do give Lord Tyrion my best when you see him.,7,2
BAELISH," I was sorry when he died. Your father and I had our differences but he loved Cat very much. So did I. She wasn't fond of you, was she? Well, it appears she vastly underestimated you. Your father and brothers are gone, yet here you stand King in the North. Last best hope against the coming storm.",7,2
JON, You don't belong down here.,7,2
BAELISH, Forgive me. We have never talked properly. I wanted to remedy that.,7,2
JON, I have nothing to say to you.,7,2
BAELISH," Not even thank you? If it weren't for me you'd have been slaughtered at that battlefield. You have many enemies, My King, but I swear to you I'm not one of them. I love Sansa as I loved her mother.",7,2
JON, Touch my sister and I'll kill you myself.,7,2
CUT TO, WINTERFELL - COURTYARD,7,2
CUT TO, RIVERLANDS,7,2
ARYA, Nymeria?,7,2
ARYA," Nymeria, it's me, Arya. I'm heading north, girl, back to Winterfell. I'm finally going home. Come with me.",7,2
ARYA, Come with me.,7,2
ARYA, That's not you.,7,2
CUT TO, SEA OF DORNE,7,2
CUT TO, SEA OF DORNE - INT. YARA'S SHIP,7,2
NYMERIA, You can't have them all. It's not fair.,7,2
OBARA, I'm oldest.,7,2
TYENE, Momma will want Cersei for herself.,7,2
OBARA, She's not my momma. You can have Cersei. I want The Mountain.,7,2
NYMERIA, The Mountain killed father. He'll crush you with one hand.,7,2
TYENE, Father got careless. That's what Momma says.,7,2
OBARA," Will you shut up about Momma? Momma, momma.",7,2
TYENE, Maybe I'll kill you both before we take King's Landing and then I won't have to share.,7,2
CUT TO, SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS,7,2
ELLARIA," How can you drink this piss? When we reach Sunspear I'll treat you to a Dornish red, the best in the world. Have you ever been to Dorne?",7,2
YARA, A few times. Never stayed long.,7,2
ELLARIA, A boy in every port?,7,2
YARA," A boy, a girl. Depends on the port.",7,2
ELLARIA, Could we get some more?,7,2
YARA, I thought it wasn't for you.,7,2
ELLARIA, I'm developing a taste for it.,7,2
YARA, He's not your servant.,7,2
THEON, It's fine.,7,2
ELLARIA," So, you're going to be Queen of the Iron Islands.",7,2
YARA, Once I kill my uncle.,7,2
ELLARIA," And what will you be, handsome?",7,2
THEON, Whatever my queen demands.,7,2
YARA," He'll be my advisor, my protector.",7,2
ELLARIA," Oh, I see. Your protector.",7,2
ELLARIA, So if someone gets too close to you --,7,2
YARA, He might have to intervene.,7,2
ELLARIA, -- hold that person back.,7,2
YARA, Until they've made their intentions known.,7,2
ELLARIA, Why are you standing all the way over there then? A foreign invasion is under way. It seems like you don't need a protector.,7,2
YARA, Stay here.,7,2
CUT TO, SEA OF DORNE - EXT. YARA'S SHIP,7,2
YARA, Euron.,7,2
YARA, Your mother is below deck. Keep her safe.,7,2

EURON, Theon!,7,2
EURON," Ah, come on your cockless hound. I have her. Come and get her.",7,2
CUT TO, SEA OF DORNE,7,2
TYRION, The bastard of Winterfell.,7,3
JON, The dwarf of Casterly Rock.,7,3
TYRION, I believe we last saw each other on top of the wall.,7,3
JON," You were pissing off the edge, if I remember right. You picked up some scars along the road.",7,3
TYRION, It's been a long road. But we're both still here.,7,3
TYRION, I'm Tyrion Lannister.,7,3
DAVOS, Davos Seaworth.,7,3
TYRION," Ah, the Onion Knight. We fought on opposite sides at the Battle of Blackwater Bay.",7,3
DAVOS, Unluckily for me.,7,3
TYRION, Missandei is the queen's most trusted advisor.,7,3
MISSANDEI, Welcome to Dragonstone. Our queen knows this is a long journey. She appreciates the effort you have made on her behalf. If you wouldn't mind handing over your weapons.,7,3
JON, Of course.,7,3
MISSANDEI," Please, this way.",7,3
DAVOS, Where are you from? I can't place the accent.,7,3
MISSANDEI, I was born on the Island of Naarth.,7,3
DAVOS, Ah. I hear it's beautiful down there. Palm trees and butterflies. I haven't been myself.,7,3
DAVOS, This place has changed.,7,3
CUT TO, DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAY,7,3
TYRION," And Sansa, I hear she's alive and well.",7,3
JON, She is.,7,3
TYRION, Does she miss me terribly?,7,3
TYRION, A sham marriage and unconsummated.,7,3
JON, I didn't ask --,7,3
TYRION," Well, it was. It wasn't. Anyway, she's much smarter than she lets on.",7,3
JON, She's starting to let on.,7,3
TYRION, Good. At some point I want to hear how a Knight's Watch recruit became King in the North.,7,3
JON, As long as you tell me how a Lannister became Hand to Daenerys Targaryen.,7,3
TYRION," A long and bloody tale. To be honest, I was drunk for most of it.",7,3
JON, My bannermen think I'm a fool for coming here.,7,3
TYRION," Of course they do. If I was your hand I would have advised against it. General rule of thumb, Stark men don't fare well when they travel south.",7,3
JON, True. But I'm not a Stark.,7,3
TYRION," I'd say you get used to them, but you never really do.",7,3
TYRION, Come. Their mother is waiting for you.,7,3
VARYS, I wondered why you weren't there to meet our guests. You begged us to summon the King in the North. Don't you want to see him again?,7,3
MELISANDRE, I've done my part. I've brought ice and fire together.,7,3
VARYS, Strange. You spoke so highly of Jon Snow but when he arrives you hide on a cliff. I didn't take you for a bashful girl.,7,3
MELISANDRE, My time whispering in the ears of kings has come to an end.,7,3
VARYS," Oh, I doubt that. Give us common folk one taste of power we're like the lion who tasted man. Nothing is ever so sweet again.",7,3
MELISANDRE," Neither of us is common folk anymore. I did not part on good terms with the King in the North, or his advisor.",7,3
VARYS, Why?,7,3
MELISANDRE, Because of mistakes I made. Terrible mistakes. I would only be a distraction if I stayed.,7,3
VARYS, So where will you go?,7,3
MELISANDRE, Volantis.,7,3
VARYS," Good. If you don't mind my saying, I don't think you should return to Westeros. I'm not sure you'd be safe here.",7,3
MELISANDRE," I will return, dear spider. One last time.",7,3
VARYS, My Lady --,7,3
MELISANDRE," I have to die in this strange country, just like you.",7,3
CUT TO, DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM,7,3
MISSANDEI," You stand in the presence of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, rightful heir to the Iron Throne, rightful Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms, the Mother of Dragons, the Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, The Unburnt, The Breaker of Chains.",7,3
DAVOS, This is Jon Snow.,7,3
DAVOS, He's King in the North.,7,3
DAENERYS," Thank you for traveling so far, My Lords. I hope the seas weren't too rough.",7,3
JON," The winds were kind, Your Grace.",7,3
DAVOS," Apologies. I have a Flea Bottom accent, I know. But Jon Snow is King in the North, Your Grace. He's not a lord.",7,3
DAENERYS, Forgive me --,7,3
TYRION," Your Grace, this is Ser Davos Seaworth.",7,3
DAERNEYS," Forgive me, Ser Davos. I never did receive a formal education, but I could have sworn the last King in the North was Torren Stark who bent the knee to my ancestor Aegon Targaryen in exchange for his life and the lives of the northmen. Torren Stark swore fealty to House Targaryen in perpetuity. But do I have my facts wrong?",7,3
DAVOS," I wasn't there, My Grace.",7,3
DAENERYS," No. Of course not. But still, an oath is an oath. In perpetuity means -- what does perpetuity mean, Lord Tyrion?",7,3
TYRION, Forever.,7,3
DAENERYS," Forever. So I assume, My Lord, that you're here to bend the knee.",7,3
JON, I am not.,7,3
DAENERYS," Oh. Well, that is unfortunate. You've travelled all this way to break faith with House Targaryen?",7,3
JON, Break faith? Your father burned my grandfather alive. He burned my uncle alive. He would have burned the Seven Kingdoms.,7,3
DAENERYS," My father was an evil man. On behalf of House Targaryen I ask your forgiveness for the crimes he committed against your family. And I ask you not to judge a daughter by the sins of her father. Our two houses were allies for centuries. Those were the best centuries the kingdom's ever known. Centuries of peace and prosperity with the Targaryens sitting on the Iron Throne and a Stark serving as Warden of the North. I am the last Targaryen, Jon Snow. Honor the pledge your ancestor made to mine. Bend the knee and I will name you Warden of the North. Together we will save this country from those who would destroy it.",7,3
JON, You're right. You're not guilty of your father's crime. And I'm not beholden to my ancestor's vows.,7,3
DAENERYS, Then why are you here?,7,3
JON, Because I need your help and you need mine.,7,3
DAENERYS, Did you see three dragons flying overhead when you arrived?,7,3
JON, I did.,7,3
DAENERYS," And did you see the Dothraki, all of whom have sworn to kill for me?",7,3
JON, They're hard to miss.,7,3
DAENERYS," But still, I need your help?",7,3
DAVOS," Not to defeat Cersei. You could storm King's Landing tomorrow and the city would fall. Hell, we almost took it and we didn't even have dragons.",7,3
TYRION, Almost.,7,3
JON, But you haven't stormed King's Landing. Why not? The only reason I can see is you don't want to kill thousands of innocent people. It's the fastest way to win the war but you won't do it. Which means at the very least you're better than Cersei.,7,3
DAENERYS," Still, that doesn't explain why I need your help.",7,3
JON," Because right now you and I and Cersei and everyone else, we're children playing at a game screaming that the rules aren't fair.",7,3
DAENERYS, You told me you liked this man.,7,3
TYRION, I do.,7,3
DAENERYS," In the time since he's met me he's refused to call me queen, he's refused to bow and now he's calling me a child.",7,3
TYRION, I believe he's calling all of us children. Figure of speech.,7,3
JON," Your Grace, everone you know will die before winter is over if we don't defeat the enemy to the north.",7,3
DAENERYS," As far as I can see, you are the enemy to the north.",7,3
JON, I am not your enemy. The dead are the enemy.,7,3
DAENERYS, The dead?,7,3
DAENERYS, Is that another figure of speech?,7,3
JON, The Army of the Dead is on the march.,7,3
TYRION, The Army of the Dead?,7,3
JON," You don't know me well, My Lord, but do you think I am a liar or a madman?",7,3
TYRION," No, I don't think you're either of those things.",7,3
JON, The Army of the Dead is real. The White Walkers are real. The Knight King is real. I've seen them. If they get past the wall and we're squabbling amongst ourselves --,7,3
JON, -- we're finished.,7,3
DAENERYS, I was born at Dragonstone. Not that I can remember it.,7,3
DAENERYS," We fled before Robert's assassins could find us. Robert was your father's best friend, no? I wonder if your father knew his best friend sent assassins to murder a baby girl in her crib. Not that it matters now of course. I spent my life in foreign lands. So many men have tried to kill me. I don't remember all of their names. I have been sold like a brood mare. I have been chained and betrayed, raped and defiled. Do you know what kept me standing through all those years in exile? Faith. Not in any gods. Not in myths and legends. In myself. In Daenerys Targaryen. The world hadn't seen a dragon in centuries until my children were born. The Dothraki hadn't crossed the sea. Any sea.",7,3
DAENERYS, They did for me. I was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms. And I will.,7,3
JON, You'll be ruling over a graveyard if we don't defeat the Night King.,7,3
TYRION, The war against my sister has already begun. You can't expect us to halt hostilities and join you in fighting --,7,3
TYRION, -- whatever you saw beyond the wall.,7,3
DAVOS, You don't believe him. I understand that. It sounds like nonsense.,7,3
DAVOS," But if destiny has brough Daenerys Targaryen back to our shores, it has also made Jon Snow King in the North. You were the first to bring Dothraki to Westeros. He was the first to make allies with Wildlings and northmen. He was named Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. He was named King in the North. Not because of his birthright. He has no birthright. He's a damn bastard. All those hard son's of bitches chose him as their leader because they believe in him.",7,3
DAVOS," All those things you don't believe in, he faced those things. He fought those things for the good of his people. He risked his life for his people. He took a knife in the heart for his people. He gave his own --",7,3
DAVOS, If we don't put asside our enmities and band together we will die. And then it doesn't matter whose skeleton sits on the Iron Throne.,7,3
TYRION, If it doesn't matter you might as well kneel.,7,3
TYRION, Swear your allegiance to Queen Daenerys. Help her to defeat my sister and together our armies will protect the north.,7,3
JON, There's no time for that. There's no time for any of this. While we stand here debating --,7,3
TYRION, It takes no time to bend the knee. Pledge your sword to her cause.,7,3
JON, And why would I do that?,7,3
JON," I mean no offense, Your Grace, but I don't know you. As far as I can tell your claim to the throne rests entirely on your father's name. And my own father fought to overthrow the Mad King. The lords of the north placed their trust in me to lead them. And I will continue to do so as well as I can.",7,3
DAENERYS," That's fair. It's also fair to point out that I'm the rightful queen of the Seven Kingdoms. By declaring yourself king of the northern most kingdom, you are in open rebellion.",7,3
DAENERYS, You must forgive my manners. You will both be tired after your long journey. We'll have baths drawn for you and supper sent to your rooms.,7,3
JON, Am I your prisoner?,7,3
DAENERYS, Not yet.,7,3
VARYS, Our Iron Born and Dornish allies were attacked on route to Dorne.,7,3
DAENERYS, And?,7,3
VARYS, Two or three ships escaped. The rest sunk our captured. Ellaria and the sand snakes dead or captured. The Greyjoys are dead or captured.,7,3
DAENERYS, All of them?,7,3
CUT TO, SEA OF DORNE,7,3
CAPTAIN, Your sister's dead?,7,3
THEON, Euron has her.,7,3
CAPTAIN, You saw him take her? And you got away?,7,3
THEON, I couldn't save her. I tried.,7,3
CAPTAIN, You wouldn't be here if you tried.,7,3
CUT TO, KING'S LANDING - STREETS,7,3
EURON(to YARA), This is the life. Look at them. Cheering for a Greyjoy.,7,3
EURON," I have to be honest, it's making me hard. Did you see little Theon's face right before he jumped overboard?",7,3
EURON, Oh no!,7,3
EURON, What a twat.,7,3
CUT TO, RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM,7,3
EURON, My queen. Please accept this gift on behalf of all of your loyal subjects in the Iron Islands.,7,3
EURON, I give you --,7,3
EURON, -- what no other man could give. Justice. Justice for your murdered daughter.,7,3
CERSEI, You've proven yourself the greatest captain on the 14 seas and a true friend to the crown.,7,3
EURON, A bit more than a true friend.,7,3
CERSEI, And you deserve a proper reward for your heroism.,7,3
EURON, There's only one reward I want.,7,3
CERSEI, You shall have what your heart desires --,7,3
CERSEI, -- when the war is won.,7,3
CERSEI," With Euron Greyjoy commanding our naval forces and Jaime Lannister leading our armies, the sons and daugters of Westeros shall defend our country.",7,3
EURON," There's nothing quite like it, is there? The love of the people. I suppose you wouldn't know.",7,3
JAIME," This same mob spat at my sister not long ago, and if you turn on us, they'll cheer to see your head mounted on a spike.",7,3
EURON," Or yours. They just like severed heads really. Listen, if you have any advice at all I'd love to hear it when we have an hour or two to speak as brothers.",7,3
JAIME, Advice?,7,3
EURON, Does she like it gentle or rough? A finger in the bum?,7,3
EURON," Shhh, shhh, shhh, not now. We'll talk later.",7,3
CUT TO, RED KEEP - DUNGEONS,7,3
CERSEI," I want you to know I understand. Even though we're enemies, you and I, I understand the fear that drives you. I was there that day when Ser Gregor crushed your lover's head. I close my eyes I can hear the sound of Oberyn's skull breaking.",7,3
CERSEI," The sound of your scream. I never heard a sound like that. I thought, that's true love. Oberyn looked beautiful that day. He really did. No one moved like him. No one had such skill with a spear. Even Ser Gregor couldn't stop him. If only he hadn't taunted him. He could have walked away and left poor Ser Gregor to die. But that wasn't your lover's way, was it? Now he's burried somewhere. And here Ser Gregor is stronger than ever. That must be difficult for you. When my daughter was taken from me, my only daughter, well, you can't imagine how that feels unless you've lost a child. I fed her at my own breast even though they told me to give her to the wet nurse. I couldn't bear to see her in another woman's arms. I never got to have a mother. But Myrcella did. She was mine and you took her from me. Why did you do that?",7,3
CERSEI, It doesn't matter now.,7,3
CERSEI," Your daughter is a beauty too. Brown eyes, those lips. A perfect Dornish beauty.",7,3
CERSEI, I imagine she is your favorite.,7,3
CERSEI," I know, I know, we're not supposed to have favorites. But still, we're only human. We love who we love.",7,3
CERSEI, I'm sorry. I can't understand you. The gag makes it difficult to understand what you're saying. It must be frustrating.,7,3
CERSEI, We all make our choices. You chose to murder my daughter. You must have felt powerful after you made that choice.,7,3
CERSEI," Do you feel powerful now? I don't sleep very well, not at all really. I lie in bed and I stare at the canopy and imagine ways of killing my enemies. How to destroy Ellaria Sand, the woman who murdered my only daughter. I thought about having Ser Gregor crush your skull the way he did Oberyn's. It would be poetic I suppose but fast. Too fast.",7,3
CERSEI, I thought about having him crush your daughter's skull.,7,3
CERSEI," She's so beautiful. The thought of this lovely face cracking open like a duck egg, no, it's just not right.",7,3
TYENE, Momma!,7,3
CERSEI," Qyburn, he's the cleverest man I know. Clever enough to learn what poison you used to murder Myrcella. The long goodbye, was that it?",7,3
QYBURN, The Long Farewell.,7,3
CERSEI, That's the one.,7,3
CERSEI, How long does the poison take?,7,3
QYBURN," Difficult to say. Hours, days, it depends on the subject's constitution.",7,3
CERSEI, But death is certain?,7,3
QYBURN," Oh yes, Your Grace, quite certain.",7,3
CERSEI," Your daughter will die here in this cell. You will be here watching when she does. You will be here the rest of your days. If you refuse to eat we will force food down your throat. You will live to watch your daughter rot, to watch that beautiful face collapse to bone and dust all the while contemplating the choices you've made.",7,3
CERSEI, Make sure the guards change the torches every few hours. I don't want her to miss a thing.,7,3
CUT TO, RED KEEP - JAIME'S QUARTERS,7,3
JAIME, No.,7,3
JAIME, Don't.,7,3
JAIME, What are you doing? No one can see us like this ?,7,3
CERSEI, I am queen of the Seven Kingdoms. I'll do as I please.,7,3
MESSENGER," Forgive me, Your Grace. The visitor from Braavos has arrived.",7,3
CERSEI, Good. And we'll need fresh sheets for the bed.,7,3
MESSENGER," At once, Your Grace.",7,3
CUT TO, RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM,7,3
TYCHO," No, thank you.",7,3
TYCHO," My condolences, Your Grace, on the death of your son. From all reports he was a fine young man.",7,3
CERSEI, The Iron Bank didn't send you hear to offer condolences.,7,3
TYCHO, Condolences and congratulations. You've become the first ruling queen in the Seven Kingdoms. That's quite an accomplishment. The Iron Bank appreciates how you cast off the yoke of superstition freeing the crown from elements that sought to subvert the rule of law.,7,3
CERSEI, The destruction of the Sept of Baelor was a tragic accident.,7,3
TYCHO, Indeed. But sometimes tragedies are necessary to restore order and rational leadership.,7,3
CERSEI, The Iron Bank wants its gold back.,7,3
TYCHO," Your father never minced words either. But, yes, your debts are considerable. And you are now engaged in a conflict on several fronts. We both know how expensive war can be.",7,3
CERSEI, And we both know gold wins wars. Your vaults are empty. Your late husband's profligacy saw to that.,7,3
TYCHO, Your wealthiest ally is the Tyrells who are now your enemies. You're surrounded on all sides by rivals for the throne.,7,3
CERSEI, And the Iron Bank wants to bet on a winner.,7,3
TYCHO, We don't make bets. We invest in endeavors we deem likely to be successful.,7,3
CERSEI, That's a fancy way of saying bet. The war has already begun. I've drawn first blood. I decapitated the Dornish snake. My armada owns the Narrow Sea.,7,3
TYCHO, Euron Greyjoy's armada owns the Narrow Sea.,7,3
CERSEI, Euron Greyjoy is loyal to me.,7,3
TYCHO, For now. Daenerys Targaryen has three full grown dragons. How well do wooden ships fare against fire breathing dragons?,7,3
CERSEI," Her dragons might not be as invulnerable as some think. Now, let's talk about the Targaryen girl. You want to invest in her? I'm guessing the Iron Bank invested considerable gold in the slave trade. How are you profits now that Daenerys has freed all the slaves?",7,3
TYCHO," The slave trade has entered a down turn, it's true.",7,3
CERSEI, From what I gather she considers herself more of a revolutionary that a monarch. In your experience how do bankers usually fare with revoltionaries?,7,3
CERSEI, The Lannisters owe the Iron Bank quite a lot of money but Lannisters always pay their debts. Do former slaves or Dothraki or dragons?,7,3
TYCHO, Your father's daughter indeed.,7,3
CERSEI, Give me a fortnight. Stay in King's Landing as my honored guest and when you return to Braavos I swear to you my debt will be paid in full.,7,3
CUT TO, DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS,7,3
TYRION, I came out here to brood over my failure to predict the Greyjoy attack. You're making it difficult. You look a lot better brooding than I do. You make me feel like I'm failing at brooding over failing.,7,3
JON, I'm a prisoner on this island.,7,3
TYRION," I wouldn't say you're a prisoner on this island. You're free to walk the castle, the beaches, to go wherever you want.",7,3
JON, Except to my ship. They took my ship.,7,3
TYRION, I wouldn't say we took your ship.,7,3
JON, I'm not playing word games with you. The dead are coming for us all.,7,3
TYRION," Why don't you figure out what to do about my missing fleet and murdered allies, and I'll figure out what to do about your walking dead men.",7,3
JON, It's hard for me to fathom. It really is. If someone told me about the White Walkers and the Night King --,7,3
JON, You probably don't believe me.,7,3
TYRION, I do actually.,7,3
JON, You didn't before. Grumpkins and snarks you called them. Do you remember? You said it was all nonsense.,7,3
TYRION," It was all nonsense. Everybody knew it. But then Mormont saw them and you saw them, and I trust the eyes of an honest man more than I trust what everybody knows.",7,3
JON, How do I convince people who don't know me that an enemey they don't believe in is coming to kill them all?,7,3
TYRION, Good question.,7,3
JON, I know it's a good question. I'm looking for an answer.,7,3
TYRION," People's minds aren't made for problems that large. White Walkers, the Night King, Army of the Dead, it's almost a relief to confront a familiar monster like my sister.",7,3
JON, I need to help prepare my people for what's coming. I can't help them from here. I'd like to leave.,7,3
TYRION, It seems unlikely that you became King in the North by giving up that easily.,7,3
JON," Everyone told me to learn from my father's mistakes. Don't go south. Don't answer a summons from the Mad King's daughter, a foreign invader. And here I am. A northern fool.",7,3
TYRION," Children are not their fathers, luckily for all of us. And sometimes there's more to foreign invaders than northern fools that meets the eye. Daenerys could have sailed for Westeros long ago but she didn't. Instead she stayed where she was and saved many people from horrible fates some of whom are on this island with us right now. While you're our guest here you might consider asking them what they think of the Mad King's daughter. She protects people from monsters, just as you do. That's why she came here. And she's not about to head north to fight an enemy she's never seen on a word of a man she doesn't know after a single meeting. That's not a reasonable thing to ask.",7,3
TYRION, So do you have anything reasonable to ask?,7,3
JON, What do you mean?,7,3
TYRION, Maybe you are a northern fool. I'm asking if there's something I can do to help you.,7,3
CUT TO, DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE,7,3
DAENERYS, Dragonglass?,7,3
TYRION," Yes. Volcanic glass, obsidian. He says you have a tremendous amount of it here.",7,3
DAENERYS, Why are we talking about glass? We just lost two of our allies.,7,3
TYRION," Which is why I was speaking to Jon Snow, a potential ally.",7,3
DAENERYS, And what does the King in the North want with Dragonglass?,7,3
TYRION," Apparently it can be turned into weapons that kill White Walkers and their foot soldiers, or stop them, destroy them. I'm unsure of the nomenclature.",7,3
DAENERYS, And what do you think of this Army of the Dead and White Walkers and Night Kings?,7,3
TYRION," I'd very much like to believe that Jon Snow is wrong, but a wise man once said that you should never believe a thing simply because you want to believe it.",7,3
DAENERYS, Which wise man said this?,7,3
TYRION, I don't remember.,7,3
DAENERYS, Are you trying to present your own statements as ancient wisdom?,7,3
TYRION," I would never do that...to you. The reason I believe Jon Snow is because he's here. All of his advisors would have told him not to come. I would have told him not to come, yet he's here anyway. You don't have to believe him. Let him mine the Dragonglass. If he's wrong it's worthless. You didn't even know it was here. It's nothing to you. Give him something by giving him nothing. Take a step toward a more productive relationship with a possible ally. Keep him occupied while we focus on the task at hand. Casterly Rock.",7,3
DAENERYS, What was that Ser Davos said about taking a knife in the heart for his people? Did you notice that?,7,3
TYRION, You must allow them their flights of fancy. It's dreary in the north.,7,3
CUT TO, DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAYS,7,3
JON, Amazing thing to see.,7,3
DAENERYS, I named them for my brothers Vicerys and Rhaegon. They're both gone now.,7,3
DAENERYS, You lost two brothers as well?,7,3
DAENERYS, People thought dragons were gone forever but here they are. Perhaps we should all be examining what we think we know.,7,3
JON, You've been talking to Tyrion?,7,3
DAENERYS, He is my Hand.,7,3
JON, He enjoys talking.,7,3
DAENERYS, We all enjoy what we're good at.,7,3
JON, I don't.,7,3
DAENERYS, You know I'm not going to let Cersei stay on the Iron Throne.,7,3
JON, I never expected that you would.,7,3
DAENERYS, And I haven't changed my mind about which kingdoms belong to the throne.,7,3
JON, I haven't either.,7,3
DAENERYS, I will allow you to mine the Dragonglass and forge weapons from it. Any resources or men you need I will provide for you.,7,3
JON, Thank you.,7,3
JON, So you believe me then about the Night King and the Army of the Dead?,7,3
DAENERYS," You better get to work, Jon Snow.",7,3
CUT TO, WINTERFELL - COURTYARD,7,3
SANSA, How much do we have?,7,3
WOLKAN," 4,000 bushels, My Lady.",7,3
SANSA, What does that mean?,7,3
YOHN," For the current occupants of the castle it's enough food for a year, perhaps more.",7,3
SANSA, What's the longest winter in the past 100 years?,7,3
WOLKAN, I'm not entirely certain. I'll check Maester Llewyn's records. He kept a copy of every raven scroll.,7,3
SANSA," You're telling me we don't have enough food, especially not if the armies of the north come back to defend Winterfell.",7,3
WOLKAN," No, My Lady, most likely not.",7,3
SANSA," We must prepare for that eventuality. Every direction the threat comes from, this is the best place to be. We need to start building up our grain stores with regular shipments from every keep in the north. If we don't use it by winter's end we'll give it back to them, but if the entire north has to flee to Winterfell there won't be enough time to bring wagonloads of grain with them.",7,3
YOHN," Very wise, My Lady.",7,3
SANSA," Maester Wolkan, you'll see to it?",7,3
SANSA, Are they covering those breastplates in leather?,7,3
YOHN," No, My Lady.",7,3
SANSA," Well, shouldn't they be once the real cold comes?",7,3
YOHN," They should indeed. Pardon me, My Lady.",7,3
YOHN," You there, why isn't there leather on these?",7,3
BAELISH, Command suits you. The northerns are all facing north worried about the threat beyond the wall.,7,3
SANSA, So they should be.,7,3
BAELISH, I know Cersei better than anyone here. If you turn your back on her --,7,3
SANSA, You don't know Cersei better than anyone here.,7,3
BAELISH, I only meant to say --,7,3
SANSA," That the woman who murdered my mother, father and brother is dangerous? Thank you for your wise council.",7,3
BAELISH," One of two things will happen. Either the dead will defeat the living, in which case all our troubles come to an end. Or life will win out. And what then?",7,3
BAELISH," Don't fight in the north or the south. Fight every battle everywhere always in your mind. Everyone is your enemy, everyone is your friend, every possible series of events is happening all at once. Live that way and nothing will surprise you. Everything that happens will be something that you've seen before.",7,3
GUARD," Lady Sansa, at the gate.",7,3
BRAN," Hello, Sansa.",7,3
CUT TO, WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE,7,3
SANSA, I wish Jon was here.,7,3
BRAN, Yes. I need to speak to him.,7,3
SANSA, Your father's last living true born son. You're Lord of Winterfell.,7,3
BRAN, I can never be the Lord of Winterfell. I can never be lord of anything. I'm the three-eyed raven.,7,3
SANSA, I don't know what that means.,7,3
BRAN, It's difficult to explain.,7,3
SANSA," Try, please, for me.",7,3
BRAN," It means I can see everything. Everything that's ever happened to everyone. Everything that's happening right now. It's all pieces, fragments. I need to learn to see better. When the long night comes again I need to be ready.",7,3
SANSA, How do you know all of this?,7,3
BRAN, The three-eyed raven taught me.,7,3
SANSA, I thought you were the three-eyed raven.,7,3
BRAN, I told you it's difficult to explain.,7,3
SANSA, Bran --,7,3
BRAN, I'm sorry for all that's happened to you. I'm sorry it had to happen here at our home. It was so beautiful that night. Snow falling just like now. And you were so beautiful in your white wedding dress.,7,3
SANSA," I have to go back inside, Bran.",7,3
BRAN, I'll stay a bit longer.,7,3
CUT TO, CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS,7,3
MARWYN, Hmm.,7,3
MARWYN, Hmm. Does it hurt?,7,3
JORAH, A bit. Less than before.,7,3
MARWYN, The infection no longer appears to be active.,7,3
MARWYN, Unusual. Unlikely. One could almost be forgiven for thinking the entire upper layer of diseased skin was debrided and the underlying region treated with some sort of ointment.,7,3
JORAH, I don't know anything about that. I just started feeling better. I assumed it was the rest that did it.,7,3
JORAH, And the climate.,7,3
MARWYN," The climate? You're free to go, Ser. This chamber is needed for the infectious, which you are no longer.",7,3
MARWYN," Tarley, I'd like to speak with you in my study this evening.",7,3
JORAH, How bad is it?,7,3
SAMWELL, I suppose I'll find out this evening.,7,3
SAMWELL, Where will you go?,7,3
JORAH, I surrendered to this sickness the moment I first saw it. I knew it would kill me or I'd kill myself before it could. Daenerys Stormborn convinced me otherwise. The only place for me is with her.,7,3
JORAH, I owe my life to her and you.,7,3
SAMWELL, Your father saved me more than once. It's the least I could do.,7,3
JORAH, Perhaps our paths will cross again?,7,3
SAMWELL, I hope they do.,7,3
CUT TO, ARCHMAESTER'S STUDY,7,3
MARWYN, You treated him?,7,3
SAMWELL, Yes.,7,3
MARWYN, Who told you to treat him?,7,3
SAMWELL, No one.,7,3
MARWYN, Who forbade you or anyone to attempt to treat him?,7,3
SAMWELL, I seem to remember you.,7,3
MARWYN, But you treated him anyway?,7,3
SAMWELL, I did.,7,3
MARWYN," I forbade it because it's dangerous and rarely successful. Especially on someone of that age. You could have infected yourself and others. You could have devastated the entire Citadel. But you didn't. It's a meticulous, difficult procedure. Many maesters whose chains are heavy with healing links have attempted it and failed. But you succeeded. How?",7,3
SAMWELL, I read the books and followed the instructions.,7,3
MARWYN, That man is alive because of you. You should be proud.,7,3
SAMWELL," Thank you, Archmaester.",7,3
MARWYN, Come here.,7,3
MARWYN, All these manuscripts and scrolls and rotting away. I need you to make copies of them.,7,3
MARWYN, You were expecting a reward? Your reward is not being immediately expelled from the Citadel. You'd better get started. Be mindful of the paper mites. They like flesh as well.,7,3
CUT TO, DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE,7,3
DAENERYS, We need to find Euron Greyjoy's fleet and sink it.,7,3
VARYS," Your Grace, he's already destroyed a good portion of our fleet. To send our remaining ships after him --",7,3
DAENERYS, I'm not talking about sending our ships after him.,7,3
TYRION, But you'll have to go yourself. Euron's ships could be anywhere or in more than one place. You'd be flying around the open seas alone for who knows how long.,7,3
DAENERYS," I wouldn't be alone. I'd have Drogon, Vicerion and Rhaegal. What can anyone do to them?",7,3
MISSANDEI, They can still do something to you. It only takes one arrow.,7,3
TYRION, It's too great a risk. You're too important.,7,3
DAENERYS, What about Casterly Rock?,7,3
VARYS, The Unsullied will be there soon.,7,3
MISSANDEI, And what will they face?,7,3
VARYS, A difficult situation. They know we're coming.,7,3
TYRION, Yes. Cersei believes my sole purpose in life is to destroy House Lannister. She will be ready.,7,3
CUT TO, CASTERLY ROCK,7,3
TYRION, No one has ever taken the rock.,7,3
TYRION," The Lannister army is still the army my father built. Well trained and well provisioned. 10,000 men at least. They will see us coming.",7,3
TYRION, They will be ready.,7,3
MAN, Draw! Loose!,7,3
TYRION, The gates of Casterly Rock are impregnable.,7,3
TYRION, The fight up the walls will be hard. We'll be at a disadvantage. Many men will die.,7,3
CUT TO, DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE,7,3
TYRION," Interesting thing about my father. He built our house up from near ruin. He built our army. He built Casterly Rock as we know it, but he didn't build the sewers. That was beneath him. So he gave the job to the lowest person he could find. Me. He was right. I was low. The company I kept low, women mostly. They weren't welcome at the Rock. Father disapproved of that sort of behavior. I couldn't walk them through the front gates. I couldn't have them in my chambers. So in the process of building the sewers I threw in something for myself.",7,3
CUT TO, CASTERLY ROCK - CLIFFS,7,3
TYRION, It was a passage that began by the sea and ended beneath one of the main guard towers.,7,3
TYRION," No better place for low pursuits. Casterly Rock, the impregnable fortress.",7,3
TYRION," As a good friend of mine once said, ""give me 10 good men and I'll impregnate the bitch.""",7,3
TYRION, And so it begins. They will face the bulk of the Lannister forces. They will be outnumbered. They will have less armor and fewer weapons.,7,3
TYRION," But as my sister's armies fights for her, the Unsullied will be fighting for something greater. They will be fighting for freedom and the person who gave it to them. They will be fighting for you. And that is why they will triump.",7,3
UNSULLIED 1, There are none left.,7,3
GREY WORM, There are supposed to be more than this. Many more.,7,3
GREY WORM, Where are they? Where are the rest of the Lannisters?,7,3
CUT TO, HIGHGARDEN - FIELDS,7,3
CUT TO, HIGHGARDEN - COURTYARD,7,3
CUT TO, OLENNA'S QUARTERS,7,3
OLENNA, It's done?,7,3
JAIME, It is.,7,3
OLENNA, And now the rains weep for our whores. Did we fight well?,7,3
JAIME, I suppose as well as can be expected.,7,3
OLENNA, It was never our forte. Golden roses indeed. Your brother and his new queen thought you would be defending Casterly Rock.,7,3
JAIME," The truth is Casterly Rock isn't worth much anymore. Well, it is to me. My fond childhood memories won't keep Cersei on the throne.",7,3
OLENNA, So you'll just let them take it?,7,3
JAIME," For now. They won't be able to hold it. Euron Greyjoy's navy burned their ships, we emptied the larders before we left. Eventually they'll be forced to abandon their position and march all the way across Westeros.",7,3
OLENNA," And you took your army, your real army, and went where they weren't?",7,3
JAIME, As Robb Stark did to me at Whispering Wood. There are always lessons in failures.,7,3
OLENNA, Yes. You must be very wise by now.,7,3
JAIME, My father always said I was a slow learner.,7,3
OLENNA," If he was so clever why didn't he take Highgarden the moment your gold mines ran dry? I suppose I'll be able to ask him myself soon enough. No more learning from my mistakes, eh? How will you do it? With that sword?",7,3
OLENNA," That was Joffrey's sword, wasn't it? Not that he ever used it. What did he call it?",7,3
JAIME, Widow's Wail.,7,3
OLENNA," He really was a cunt, wasn't he? I did unspeakable things to protect my family, or watched them being done on my orders. I never lost a night's sleep over them. They were necessary. And whatever I imagined necessary for the safety of House Tyrell I did. But your sister has done things I wasn't capable of imagining. That was my prize mistake, a failure of imagination. She's a monster, you do know that?",7,3
JAIME," To you, sure. To others as well. But after we've won and there's no one left to oppose us, the people living peaceful in the world she built, do you really think they'll wring their hands over the way she built it?",7,3
OLENNA, You love her. You really do love her. You poor fool. She'll be the end of you.,7,3
JAIME," Possibly. Not much to be gained from discussing it with you though, is there?",7,3
OLENNA, What better person to discuss it with? What better guarantee could you have that the things you say will never leave this room? But perhaps you're right. If she's driven you this far it's gone beyond your control.,7,3
JAIME," Yes, it has.",7,3
OLENNA, She's a disease. I regret my role in spreading it. You will too.,7,3
JAIME, I think we're done here.,7,3
OLENNA, How will it happen?,7,3
JAIME, Cersei had several ideas. Whipping you through the streets and beheading you in front of the Red Keep. Flaying you alive and hanging you from the walls of King's Landing. I talked her out of those.,7,3
OLENNA, Will there be pain?,7,3
JAIME, No. I made sure of that.,7,3
OLENNA, That's good.,7,3
OLENNA," I'd hate to die like your son clawing at my neck, foam and bile spilling from my mouth, eyes blood red, skin purple. It must have been horrible for you as a Kingsguard, as a father. It was horrible enough for me. A shocking scene. Not at all what I intended. You see, I'd never seen the posion work before. Tell Cersei. I want her to know it was me.",7,3
JAIME, Halt that wagon!,7,4
BRONN, You just won the biggest prize in the world. What could you possibly have to be upset about? Come on. You can tell me. Queen of Thorns give you one last prick in the balls before saying goodbye?,7,4
JAIME, I'll save my confessions for the High Septon.,7,4
BRONN, There is no more High Septon.,7,4
JAIME," No, there isn't, is there?",7,4
BRONN, There is still the question of my prize.,7,4
JAIME, That's a lot of money I just gave you.,7,4
BRONN, It's not a castle.,7,4
BRONN, How about that one? It's available.,7,4
JAIME, You don't want Highgarden.,7,4
BRONN, I beg to differ.,7,4
JAIME," We're at war. Daenerys Targaryen could come take it back the day after you move in. Besides, think of the upkeep. The more you own, the more it weighs you down.",7,4
BRONN," Oh, is that why you're so fucking glum, eh? All your new riches weighing you down?",7,4
JAIME, They're not mine. The gold belongs to the Iron Bank. We pay our debts.,7,4
BRONN, Right. Just not to me.,7,4
JAIME," Bronn of the Blackwater, formerly of whatever nameless shit heap you're from with a saddlebag full of gold complaining about not getting paid. When we win this war all the castles in the Seven Kingdoms will be yours to choose from with no one left to take them away from you.",7,4
BRONN," Yes, I'm sure Queen Cersei's reign will be quiet and peaceful.",7,4
JAIME, Stranger things have happened.,7,4
BRONN, Like what?,7,4
RANDYLL," The granaries are being emptied and loaded into wagons, My Lord.",7,4
JAIME, The current harvest?,7,4
DICKON, We have teams of men collecting it and more farmers in the Reach.,7,4
JAIME," Ser Bronn, will you accompany the Tarleys and help them accelerate this process?",7,4
BRONN, I'm not much for shoveling weight.,7,4
JAIME," No, but motivating reluctant farmers to hand over their harvest, I've heard you guys have a real talent for that.",7,4
RANDYLL, My Lord.,7,4
DICKON, My Lord.,7,4
CUT TO, REDKEEP - COUNCIL ROOM,7,4
TYCHO," I must say, I don't think the Iron Bank has ever had a debt of this magnitude repaid in a single installment. I always considered your father a very effective and efficient man, but you appear to be redefining those terms entirely.",7,4
CERSEI," You're too kind, My Lord.",7,4
TYCHO," I am neither kind, nor a lord, Your Grace. I am merely an instrument of the institution I represent, its wellbeing is a matter of arithmetic, not sentiment. And the current arithmetic is outstanding. The gold --",7,4
CERSEI, Is on its way. My brother is supervising its transportation himself.,7,4
TYCHO, Some at the Iron Bank will be disappointed. They've grown rather fond of your interest payments.,7,4
CERSEI, We must devise a way to raise their spirits.,7,4
TYCHO, Yes. Perhaps we could be of assistance in some current venture.,7,4
CERSEI, My only venture at the moment is reestablishing control over this continent and every person on it.,7,4
TYCHO, I see a great deal of potential in that venture. I imagine that it would require outside investment?,7,4
CERSEI," It will indeed. I need to expand my armies, my navies. My hand, Qyburn, had made overtures to the Golden Company in Essos.",7,4
TYCHO, I know them well. They've helped us recover significant sums from parties who had fallen into deep arrears.,7,4
CERSEI, That's good to hear. I too would like them to recover some things that belong to me.,7,4
TYCHO," Rest assured, Your Grace, you can count on the Iron Bank's support, as soon as the gold arrives.",7,4
CUT TO, WINTERFELL - BRAN'S QUARTERS,7,4
BAELISH, This is for you.,7,4
BAELISH," The last man who wielded it meant to cut your throat, but your mother fought him off.",7,4
BAELISH," The other dagger, the one that took her life, I would have stopped that dagger with my own heart if I could have. I wasn't there for her when she needed me most. But I am here for her now. To do what she would have done, to protect her children. Anything I can do for you, Brandon, you need only ask.",7,4
BRAN, Do you know who this belonged to?,7,4
BAELISH," No. That very question was what started the War of the Five Kings. In a way, that dagger made you what you are today. Forced from your home, driven out to the wilds beyond the Wall. I imagine you've seen things most men wouldn't believe.",7,4
BAELISH," To go through all of that and make your way home again only to find such chaos in the world, I can only imagine --",7,4
BRAN, Chaos is a ladder.,7,4
BAELISH," I'm sorry to have disturbed you, Lord Stark.",7,4
BRAN, I'm not Lord Stark.,7,4
MEERA, What's that?,7,4
BRAN, Maester Wolkan built it for me so I can move around more easily.,7,4
MEERA, It's a very good idea.,7,4
BRAN, You're leaving?,7,4
MEERA," I don't want to leave you, but when they come I need to be with my family. And you're safe, safe as anyone can be now. You don't need me anymore.",7,4
BRAN," No, I don't.",7,4
MEERA, That's all you've got to say?,7,4
BRAN, Thank you.,7,4
MEERA, Thank you?,7,4
BRAN, For helping me.,7,4
MEERA, My brother died for you. Hodor and Summer died for you. I almost died for you. Bran!,7,4
BRAN," I'm not really, not anymore. I remember what it felt like to be Brandon Stark, but I remember so much else now.",7,4
MEERA, You died in that cave.,7,4

SANSA, Yes.,7,4
SANSA, You shouldn't have run from the guards.,7,4
ARYA, I didn't run. You need better guards.,7,4
ARYA," It suits you, Lady Stark. Jon left you in charge?",7,4
SANSA," He did. I hope he comes back soon. I remember how happy he was to see me. When he sees you, his heart will probably stop.",7,4

ARYA, Me too. I was angry when I heard someone else had done it. However long my list got he was always first.,7,4
SANSA, Your list?,7,4
ARYA, Of people I'm going to kill.,7,4
SANSA, How did you get back to Winterfell?,7,4
ARYA, It's a long story. I imagine yours is too.,7,4
SANSA, Yes. It's not a very pleasant one.,7,4
ARYA," Mine neither, but our stories aren't over yet.",7,4
SANSA," No, they're not.",7,4
SANSA," Arya, Bran's home too.",7,4
CUT TO, WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE,7,4
BRAN, You came home.,7,4
BRAN, I saw you at the crossroads.,7,4
ARYA, You saw me?,7,4
BRAN, I see quite a lot now.,7,4
SANSA, Bran has visions.,7,4
BRAN, I thought you might go to King's Landing.,7,4
ARYA, So did I.,7,4
SANSA, Why would you go back there?,7,4
BRAN, Cersei is on her list of names.,7,4
SANSA, Who else is on your list?,7,4
ARYA, Most of them are dead already.,7,4
ARYA, Where did you get this?,7,4
BRAN, Littlefinger gave it to me.,7,4
ARYA," Littlefinger, he's here?",7,4
SANSA, He's declared for House Stark.,7,4
SANSA, Why would he give you a dagger?,7,4
BRAN, He thought I'd want it.,7,4
SANSA, Why?,7,4
BRAN, Because it was meant to kill me.,7,4
SANSA, The cutthroat after your fall?,7,4
ARYA, Why would a cutthroat have a Valyrian steel dagger?,7,4
BRAN, Someone very wealthy wanted me dead.,7,4
SANSA, He's not a generous man. He wouldn't give you anything unless he thought he was getting something back.,7,4
BRAN, It doesn't matter.,7,4
SANSA, What do you mean it doesn't matter?,7,4
BRAN, I don't want it.,7,4
ARYA, Are you sure? It's Valyrian steel.,7,4
BRAN, It's wasted on a cripple.,7,4
CUT TO, WINTERFELL - GATE,7,4
PODRICK, Catelyn Stark would be proud. You kept your vow.,7,4
BRIENNE, I did next to nothing.,7,4
PODRICK," You're too hard on yourself, My Lady.",7,4
BRIENNE, I'm not a --,7,4
BRIENNE," Thank you, Podrick.",7,4
CUT TO, DRAGONSTONE,7,4
MISSANDEI," Your Grace, there's still no word from the Unsullied.",7,4
DAENERYS, Soon. They will come back to me.,7,4
MISSANDEI, He better.,7,4
DAENERYS, What happened?,7,4
MISSANDEI, Many things.,7,4
DAENERYS, Many things?,7,4
JON, Your Grace.,7,4
DAENERYS, It's all right.,7,4
JON, I wanted you to see it before we start hacking it to bits.,7,4
JON," So this is it, all we'll ever need.",7,4
JON," There is something else I want to show your, Your Grace.",7,4
JON, The Children of the Forest made these.,7,4
DAENERYS, When?,7,4
JON, A very long time ago.,7,4
DAENERYS, They were right here standing where we're standing before there were Targaryens or Starks or Lannisters. Maybe even before there were men.,7,4
JON, No.,7,4
JON, They were here together the Children and the First Men.,7,4
DAENERYS, Doing what? Fighting each other?,7,4
DAENERYS," They fought together against their common enemy. Despite their differences, despite their suspicions, together. We need to do the same if we're going to survive.",7,4
JON, Because the enemy is real. It's always been real.,7,4
DAENERYS, And you say you can't defeat them without my armies and my dragons?,7,4
JON," No, I don't think I can.",7,4
DAENERYS, I will fight for you. I will fight for the north...when you bend the knee.,7,4
JON," My people won't accept a southern ruler, not after everything they've suffered.",7,4
DAENERYS, They will if their king does. They chose you to lead them. They chose you to protect them. Isn't their survival more important than your pride?,7,4
DAENERYS, What is it?,7,4
TYRION, We took Casterly Rock.,7,4
DAENERYS, That's very good to hear.,7,4
DAENERYS, Isn't it?,7,4
CUT TO, DRAGONSTONE - BEACH,7,4
DAVOS, You'll want to discuss this amongst yourselves. Perhaps --,7,4
DAENERYS, You will stay. All my allies are gone. They've been taken from me while I've been sitting here on this island.,7,4
TYRION, We still have the largest army.,7,4
DAENERYS, Who won't be able to eat because Cersei has taken all the food from the Reach.,7,4
TYRION, Call Grey Worm and the Unsullied back. We still have enough ships to carry the Dothraki to the mainland. Commit to the blockade of King's Landing. We have a plan. It's still the right plan.,7,4
DAENERYS," The right plan? Your strategy has lost us Dorne, the Iron Islands and the Reach.",7,4
TYRION, If I've underestimated our enemies --,7,4
DAENERYS," Our enemies? Your family, you mean. Perhaps you don't want to hurt them after all.",7,4
DAENERYS, Enough with the clever plans.,7,4
DAENERYS, I have three large dragons. I'm going to fly them to the Red Keep.,7,4
TYRION, We've discussed this.,7,4
DAENERYS, My enemies are in the Red Keep. What kind of a queen am I if I'm not willing to risk my life to fight them?,7,4
TYRION, A smart one.,7,4
DAENERYS, What do you think I should do?,7,4
JON, I would never presume to --,7,4
DAENERYS, I'm at war. I'm losing.,7,4
DAENERYS, What do you think I should do?,7,4
JON, I never thought that dragons would exist again. No one did. The people who follow you know that you made something impossible happen. Maybe that helps them believe that you can make other impossible things happen. Build a world that's different from the shit one they've always known.,7,4
JON," But if you use them to melt castles and burn cities, you're not different. You're just more of the same.",7,4
CUT TO, WINTERFELL - COURTYARD,7,4
BRIENNE, Don't lunge.,7,4
BRIENNE, Don't go where your enemy leads you.,7,4
BRIENNE, Up.,7,4
BRIENNE, And don't --,7,4
ARYA, Don't fight someone like her in the first place.,7,4
BRIENNE, Nice sword. Very nice dagger.,7,4
SANSA, If they haven't contributed the right amount of grain to the stores then I'm afraid they'll have to make due with --,7,4
ARYA(TO BRIENNE), It's been awhile since I've trained.,7,4
BRIENNE," I can go and find the Master of Arms for you, My Lady.",7,4
ARYA, He didn't beat the hound. You did. I want to train with you.,7,4
ARYA," You swore to serve both of my mother's daughters, didn't you?",7,4
BRIENNE," Move aside, Podrick.",7,4
BRIENNE," You can't use that, My Lady. It's too small.",7,4
ARYA, I won't cut you. Don't worry.,7,4
BRIENNE, I'll try not to.,7,4
BRIENNE, Who taught you to do that?,7,4
ARYA, No one.,7,4
CUT TO, DRAGONSTONE,7,4
DAVOS, What do you think of her?,7,4
JON, Who?,7,4
DAVOS, I believe you know of whom I speak.,7,4
JON, I think she has a good heart.,7,4
DAVOS, A good heart? I've noticed you starring at that good heart.,7,4
JON," There's no time for that. I saw the Night King, Davos. I looked into his eyes. How many men do we have in the north to fight him? 10,000? Less?",7,4
DAVOS, Fewer.,7,4
JON, What?,7,4
DAVOS," Speaking of good hearts, Missandei of Naarth.",7,4
MISSANDEI," Ser Davos, Lord Snow.",7,4
DAVOS," King Snow, isn't it? No? That doesn't sound right. King Jon?",7,4
JON, It doesn't matter.,7,4
MISSANDEI," Forgive me, but may I ask a question?",7,4
JON, Of course.,7,4
MISSANDEI," Your name is Jon Snow, but your father's name was Ned Stark?",7,4
JON, I'm a bastard. My mother and father weren't married.,7,4
DAVOS, Is the custom different in Naarth?,7,4
MISSANDEI, We don't have marriage in Naarth so the concept of a bastard doesn't exist.,7,4
DAVOS, The sounds liberating.,7,4
JON, Why did you leave your homeland?,7,4
MISSANDEI, I was stolen away by slavers.,7,4
JON, I'm sorry.,7,4
DAVOS," If I may, how did a slave girl come to advise Daenerys Targaryen?",7,4
MISSANDEI, She bought me from my master and set me free.,7,4
DAVOS," That was good of her. Of course you're serving her now, aren't you?",7,4
MISSANDEI, I serve my queen because I want to serve my queen. Because I believe in her.,7,4
JON, And if you wanted to sail home to Naarth tomorrow --,7,4
MISSANDEI, Then she would give me a ship and wish me good fortune.,7,4
JON, You believe that?,7,4
MISSANDEI," I know it. All of us who came with her from Essos, we believe in her. She's not our queen because she's the daughter of some king we never knew. She's the queen we chose.",7,4
DAVOS(to JON), You'll forgive me if I switch sides.,7,4
JON, Is that a Greyjoy ship?,7,4
CUT TO, DRAGONSTONE - BEACH,7,4
THEON, Jon. I didn't know you were here.,7,4
THEON," Sansa, is she all right?",7,4
JON, What you did for her is the only reason I'm not killing you.,7,4
DAVOS, We heard your uncle attacked your fleet. We thought you were dead.,7,4
THEON, I should be.,7,4
DAVOS, Your sister?,7,4
THEON, Euron has her. I came to ask the queen to help get her back.,7,4
JON, The queen is gone.,7,4
THEON, Where did she go?,7,4
CUT TO, KING'S LANDING - FIELDS,7,4
RANDYLL, All of the gold is safely through the gates of King's Landing.,7,4
JAIME, Good.,7,4
RANDYLL," We need to get the last of these wagons over the Blackwater Rush before nightfall. If the head of the line is ambushed, the tail will never be able to reinforce in time.",7,4
JAIME, We are stretched a bit thin.,7,4
RANDYLL," With your permission, flogging stragglers has a marked effect on mobility.",7,4
JAIME, Let's give them fair warning first. These men fought well at Highgarden.,7,4
DICKON, Ser Jaime.,7,4
JAIME, Rickon.,7,4
DICKON, Dickon.,7,4
JAIME, I hear you fought bravely at Highgarden. Your first battle?,7,4
JAIME, And?,7,4
DICKON, It was glorious.,7,4
BRONN, Come on. Your father's not here.,7,4
DICKON, All my life we've been pledged to House Tyrell. I knew some of those men. I hunted with them.,7,4
JAIME, They didn't deserve to die. But Lady Olenna chose to betray the queen and support the Targaryen girl. So here we are.,7,4
DICKON, I didn't expect it to smell like that.,7,4
BRONN, Men shit themselves when they die. Didn't they teach you that at fancy lad school?,7,4
BRONN," Well, I learned it when I was 5.",7,4
JAIME, What?,7,4
BRONN, Listen.,7,4
JAIME, Spears and shields! Spears and shields!,7,4
JAIME, Spears and shields!,7,4
BRONN, In line now!,7,4
RANDYLL," Come on, lads. Not those wagons. Fall in line. Fall in line.",7,4
RANDYLL, Spears armed!,7,4
BRONN, Get back to King's Landing.,7,4
JAIME, I'm not abandoning my army.,7,4
BRONN," You're a commander, not a damned infantryman. These fuckers are about to swamp us.",7,4
JAIME, We can hold them off.,7,4
DAENERYS, Dracarys!,7,4
JAIME, Hold the line!,7,4
JAIME, Archers! Archers with me!,7,4
JAIME, Knock!,7,4
ARCHERS, Knock! Draw!,7,4
JAIME, Loose!,7,4
JAIME, Qyburn's scorpion is over there.,7,4
BRONN, Go get it then.,7,4
JAIME, I can't shoot with one hand.,7,4
JAIME, Come on!,7,4
BRONN, Where are you?,7,4
GUARD, Your people can't fight.,7,4
JAIME, Take cover!,7,4
BRONN, Come on you fucker.,7,4
DAENERYS, Dracarys!,7,4
TYRION," Flee, you idiot!",7,4
JAIME," Come on, boy. Come on!",7,4
TYRION, You fucking idiot.,7,4
JAIME, You could have killed me.,7,5
BRONN, What the fuck were you doing back there?,7,5
JAIME, Ending the war by killing her.,7,5
BRONN, You saw the dragon between you and her?,7,5
BRONN, And?,7,5
BRONN," Listen to me, cunt. Till I get what I'm owed, a dragon doesn't get to kill you. You don't get to kill you. Only I get to kill you.",7,5
JAIME," That was only one of them. She has two more. If she decides to use them, to really use them --",7,5
BRONN, You're fucked.,7,5
JAIME, Don't you mean we're fucked?,7,5
BRONN," No, I do not. Dragons are where our partnership ends. I'm not going to be around when those things start spitting fire on King's Landing.",7,5
JAIME, I have to tell Cersei.,7,5
BRONN, Best well jump back in that river.,7,5
CUT TO, KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND,7,5
DAENERYS," I know what Cersei has told you, that I've come to destroy your cities --",7,5
DAENERYS," -- burn down your homes, murder you and orphan your children. That's Cersei Lannister, not me. I'm not here to murder. And all I want to destroy is the wheel that is rolled over rich and poor to the benefit of no one but the Cersei Lannisters of the world. I offer you a choice. Bend the knee and join me. Together we will leave the world a better place than we found it, or refuse and die.",7,5
DAENERYS," Step forward, My Lord.",7,5
DAENERYS, You will not kneel?,7,5
RANDYLL, I already have a queen.,7,5
TYRION," My sister, she wasn't your queen until recently though, was she, until she murdered your rightful queen and destroyed House Tyrell for all time. So it appears your allegiances are somewhat flexible.",7,5
RANDYLL," There are no easy choices in war. Say what you will about your sister, she was born in Westeros, has lived here all her life. You on the other hand, you murdered your own father and chose to support a foreign invader. One with no ties to this land, an army of savages at her back.",7,5
DAENERYS, You will not trade your honor for your life. I respect that.,7,5
TYRION," Perhaps he could take the black, Your Grace. Whatever else he is, he is a true soldier. He would be invaluable at the Wall.",7,5
RANDYLL, You cannot send me to the Wall. You are not my queen.,7,5
DICKON, You will have to kill me too.,7,5
RANDYLL, Step back and shut your mouth.,7,5
DAENERYS(to DICKON), Who are you?,7,5
RANDYLL, A stupid boy.,7,5
DICKON," I'm Dickon Tarley, son of Randyll Tarley.",7,5
TYRION, You are the future of your house. This war has already wiped one great house from the world. Don't let it happen again. Bend the knee.,7,5
DICKON, I will not.,7,5
TYRION," Your Grace, nothing strips bold notions from a man's head like a few weeks in a dark cell.",7,5
DAENERYS, I meant what I said. I'm not here to put men in chains. If that becomes an option many will take it. I gave them a choice. They made it.,7,5
TYRION," Your Grace, if you begin beheading entire families --",7,5
DAENERYS, I'm not beheading anyone.,7,5
TYRION, Your Grace --,7,5
DAENERYS," Lord Randyll Tarley, Dickon Tarley, I, Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of my name, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons, sentence you to die.",7,5
DAENERYS, Dracarys.,7,5
CUT TO, KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY,7,5
QYBURN, My Lord.,7,5
CERSEI, How many men did we lose?,7,5
JAIME, We haven't done a full counting.,7,5
CERSEI," It's armies that win wars. We have the Tyrell gold, we have the Iron Bank behind us. We can buy mercenaries.",7,5
CERSEI," They're not the same as our men but they'll fight if they're well paid, which they will be.",7,5
JAIME," I just saw the Dothraki fight. They'll beat any mercenary army. They'll beat any army I've ever seen. Killing our men wasn't war for them, it was sport. Her dragon burned a thousand wagons. Qyburn's scorpion fired bolts bigger than you. They couldn't stop it. And she has three of them. This isn't a war we can win.",7,5
CERSEI," So what do we do? Sue for peace? I sit on her father's throne, the father you betrayed and murdered. And in her mind she's winning. What sort of offer do you think she'd make?",7,5
CERSEI, Maybe we can count on Tyrion to intercede on our behalf by way of apology for murdering our father and our son.,7,5
JAIME, He didn't.,7,5
CERSEI," You saw the crossbow, you saw his body.",7,5
JAIME, I'm not talking about father. Tyrion didn't kill Joffrey. He had nothing to do with it.,7,5
CERSEI, After all this time it still amazes me --,7,5
JAIME, It was Olenna. She confessed before she died.,7,5
CERSEI, And this was before or after she drank the poison you so kindly provided her?,7,5
JAIME, After.,7,5
CERSEI, And you believed her?,7,5
JAIME, If you were Olenna would you rather have seen your granddaughter married to Joffrey or Tommen? Which one would Margerey been better able to control? Which one would have made Olenna the true ruler of the Seven Kingdoms? She was telling the truth.,7,5
CERSEI, I shouldn't have listened to you. She should have died screaming.,7,5
JAIME," She's dead like her son, her grandchildren, her whole house. And if we don't find a way out of this war we'll follow them.",7,5
CERSEI, So we fight and die or we submit and die. I know my choice. A soldier should know his.,7,5
CUT TO, EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS,7,5
DAENERYS," They're beautiful, aren't they?",7,5
JON," That wasn't the word I was thinking of, but, yes, they are. Gorgeous beasts.",7,5
DAENERYS," They're not beasts to me. No matter how big they get, how terrifying to everyone else, they're my children.",7,5
JON, You weren't gone long.,7,5
DAENERYS, No.,7,5
JON, And?,7,5
DAENERYS, And I have fewer enemies today than I did yesterday.,7,5
DAENERYS, You're not sure how you feel about that?,7,5
JON," No, I'm not.",7,5
DAENERYS, How many men did your army kill taking Winterfell back from the Boltons?,7,5
JON, Thousands.,7,5
DAENERYS, We both want to help people. We can only help them from a position of strength. Sometimes strength is terrible. When you first came here Ser Davos said you took a knife in the heart for your people.,7,5
JON, Ser Davos gets carried away.,7,5
DAENERYS, So it was a figure of speech?,7,5
GUARD," This man says he is your friend, Khaleesi.",7,5
DAENERYS, He is my friend.,7,5
JORAH, Your Grace.,7,5
DAENERYS," Jon Snow, this is Ser Jorah Mormont, an old friend.",7,5
JON, I served with your father. He was a great man.,7,5
DAENERYS, You look strong. You found a cure?,7,5
JORAH," I wouldn't be here if I hadn't. I return to your service, my queen, if you'll have me.",7,5
DAENERYS, It would be my honor.,7,5
CUT TO, EXT. WINTERFELL,7,5
CUT TO, WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE,7,5
BRAN, Ravens. We need to send ravens.,7,5
CUT TO, CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER,7,5
MAESTER 1," I put very little stock in it myself. Prophecies of doom are never in short supply, especially when winter comes.",7,5
MARWYN, I remember Wolkan. A bit timid but a sharp mind.,7,5
MAESTER 1," The north has dulled many good maester's wits. I'm not sure if it's the cold, the drink, or the company.",7,5
MAESTER 1, A crippled boy claims to have seen dead men on the march beyond the wall thanks to the magical help of a raven with three eyes.,7,5
MARWYN, It is a bit much. Still we ought to --,7,5
SAMWELL, Brandon Stark --,7,5
SAMWELL, -- the crippled boy.,7,5
MARWYN, Do you know him?,7,5
SAMWELL, I let him through the Wall years ago. I saw him go beyond the wall.,7,5
MARWYN, And?,7,5
SAMWELL," Somehow a crippled boy survived for years beyond the wall when no one else could. Not the Night's Watch, not the Wildlings, no one. Perhaps we ought to listen to what he has to say.",7,5
MAESTER 1, Perhaps you need more scribing work to discipline your mind.,7,5
MARWYN, I sense a more detailed proposal is forthcoming.,7,5
SAMWELL," Everyone in Westeros trusts and respects you. If you tell people the threat is real they'll believe it. If you advise all the lords to send their men north to hold the wall they'll do it. And if you tell every maester in the Citadel to search every word of every faded scroll about the long night, they may find something that lets us defeat the Army of the Dead for good.",7,5
MARWYN, It could be done. And this news could be authentic. It's possible. It's also possible this message is part of a ploy by the dragon queen to lure southern armies away from the lands they are currently defending to open those lands to easy conquest.,7,5
MAESTER 1, That does seem far more likely than magic birds talking to cripples.,7,5
SAMWELL," Archmaester, please. It's real. I've seen it.",7,5
MARWYN, We will write to Maester Wolkan at Winterfell for clarification. I promise you we will get to the truth of it one way or another.,7,5
SAMWELL, Archmaester --,7,5
MARWYN," That will be all, Tarley.",7,5
MAESTER 2," It brings to mind the work of Davy Moonstone, the charlatan who claimed to see the children of the forest.",7,5
MAESTER 1, Don't forget the Prophet Lodock that promised the Drowned God would rise up and destroy Aegon the Conquerer.,7,5
MAESTER 1, Is he the one whose father and brother were just burned alive?,7,5
MARWYN, I'm afraid so.,7,5
MAESTER 2, Horrible business.,7,5
MARWYN, I don't have the heart to tell him yet. He's a good lad.,7,5
MARWYN, Right. The ravenry was falling apart last time I checked...,7,5
CUT TO, DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM,7,5
TYRION, All rulers demand that people bend the knee. It's why they're rulers. She gave Tarley a choice. A man who had taken up arms against her. What else could she do?,7,5
VARYS, Not burn him alive alongside his son.,7,5
TYRION," I am her hand, not her head. I can't make her decisions for her.",7,5
VARYS, That's what I used to tell myself about her father. I found the traitors but I wasn't the one burning them alive. I was only a purveyor of information.,7,5
VARYS," It's what I told myself when I watched them beg for mercy, ""I'm not the one doing it."" As the pitch of their screams rose higher, ""I'm not the one doing it."" When their hair caught fire and the smell of the burning flesh filled the Thone Room, ""I'm not the one doing it.""",7,5
TYRION, Daenerys is not her father.,7,5
VARYS, And she never will be... with the right counsel. You need to find a way to make her listen.,7,5
TYRION, Who is that for?,7,5
VARYS, Jon Snow.,7,5
TYRION, Did you read it?,7,5
VARYS, It's a sealed scroll for the King in the North.,7,5
TYRION, What's it say?,7,5
VARYS, Nothing good.,7,5
CUT TO, DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE,7,5
JON, I thought Arya was dead. I thought Bran was dead.,7,5
DAENERYS, I'm happy for you. You don't look happy.,7,5
JON, Bran saw the Night King and his army marching towards Eastwatch. If they make it past the wall --,7,5
VARYS, The Wall has kept them out for thousands of years. Presumably --,7,5
JON, I need to go home.,7,5
DAENERYS, You said you don't have enough men.,7,5
JON, We'll fight with the men we have. Unless you'll join us.,7,5
DAENERYS, And give the country to Cersei? As soon as I march away she marches in.,7,5
TYRION, Perhaps not. Cersei thinks the Army of the Dead is nothing but a story made up by wet nurses to frighten children. What if we prove her wrong?,7,5
JON, I don't think she'll come see the dead at my invitation.,7,5
TYRION, So bring the dead to her.,7,5
DAENERYS, I thought that was what we are trying to avoid.,7,5
TYRION, We don't have to bring the whole army. Only one soldier.,7,5
DAVOS(to JON), Is that possible?,7,5
JON, The first White I ever saw was brought into Castle Black from beyond the Wall.,7,5
TYRION, Bring one of these things down to King's Landing and show her the truth.,7,5
VARYS, Anything you bring back will be useless unless Cersei grants us an audience and is somehow convinced not to murder us the moment we set foot in the capital.,7,5
TYRION, The only person she listens to is Jaime. He may listen to me.,7,5
DAENERYS, And how would you get into King's Landing.,7,5
DAVOS," I can smuggle you in, but if the Goldcloaks were to recognize you, I'm warning you, I'm not a fighter.",7,5
DAENERYS," Well, it will all be for nothing if we don't have one of these dead men.",7,5
VARYS, Fair point. How do you propose to find one?,7,5
JORAH, With the queen's permission I'll go north and take one.,7,5
JORAH, You asked me to find a cure so I could serve you. Allow me to serve you.,7,5
JON, The free folk will help us. They know the real north better than anyone.,7,5
DAVOS, They won't follow Ser Jorah.,7,5
JON, They won't have to.,7,5
DAVOS, You can't lead a raid beyond the wall. You're not in the Night's Watch anymore. You're King in the North.,7,5
JON, I'm the only one here whose fought them. I'm the only one here who knows them.,7,5
DAENERYS, I haven't given you permission to leave.,7,5
JON," With respect, Your Grace, I don't need your permission. I am a king. And I came here knowing that you could have your men behead me or your dragons burn me alive. I put my trust in you, a stranger, because I knew it was the best chance for my people, for all our people. Now I'm asking you to trust in a stranger because it's our best chance.",7,5
CUT TO, WINTERFELL - THE GREAT HALL,7,5
ROBETT," The King in the North should stay in the north. We did not choose you to rule us, My Lady, but perhaps we should have.",7,5
YOHN," The Knights of the Vale came here for you, Lady Stark.",7,5
SANSA," You're very kind, my lords, but Jon is our king. He is doing what he thinks is best.",7,5
CUT TO, WINTERFELL - HALLS,7,5
SANSA, I warned Jon this would happen. He can't leave the north and expect it to just sit and wait for him like Ghost.,7,5
ARYA, He didn't. He trusted you to hold it for him.,7,5
SANSA," Well, he's not making it easy. The northern lords are proud.",7,5
ARYA, These are mother and father's chambers.,7,5
SANSA, And?,7,5
ARYA, Nothing.,7,5
SANSA, Don't do that.,7,5
ARYA, What?,7,5
SANSA, Say what you mean.,7,5
ARYA, You always liked nice things. It made you feel better than everyone.,7,5
SANSA, Are you angry with me?,7,5
ARYA, They were insulting Jon and you sat there and listened.,7,5
SANSA," I listened to their complaints, which is my responsibility as Lady of Winterfell.",7,5
ARYA, Their opinions are important to you?,7,5
SANSA," Glover has 500 men. Royce has 2,000. Offend them and Jon loses his army.",7,5
ARYA, Not if they lose their heads first.,7,5
SANSA," Winterfell didn't just fall into our hands. We took it back, and the Mormonts and the Hornwoods and the Wildlings and the Vale, all of us working together. Now, I'm sure cutting off heads is very satisfying, but that's not the way you get people to work together.",7,5
ARYA," And if Jon doesn't come back, you'll need their support, so you can work together to give you what you really want.",7,5
SANSA, How can you even think such a horrible thing?,7,5
ARYA," You're thinking it right now. You don't want to be, but the thought just won't go away.",7,5
SANSA, I have work to do.,7,5
ARYA, My lady.,7,5
CUT TO, KING'S LANDING - BEACH,7,5
TYRION, Last time I was here I killed my father with a crossbow.,7,5
DAVOS, Last time I was here you killed my son with wildfire.,7,5
DAVOS, There's a path to the left that hugs the cliff. The guards hardly ever patrol it. Too many steps.,7,5
TYRION, You're not staying here?,7,5
DAVOS, I've got my own business in Flea Bottom.,7,5
TYRION, What if someone takes the boat?,7,5
DAVOS, Then we're fucked. Best hurry.,7,5
CUT TO, REDKEEP - DUNGEONS,7,5
JAIME, We don't have time for this. We should be preparing the city for a siege. The Dothraki are coming.,7,5
BRONN, All the more reason for you to train. Unless you plan on fighting Dothraki 12 year olds.,7,5
JAIME, I seem to recall them giving you a bit of trouble as well.,7,5
BRONN, And here I am ready to train.,7,5
JAIME, Why down here?,7,5
BRONN, I don't think you want people to see how you look swinging that thing yet.,7,5
JAIME, Today might be the day I kill you by accident.,7,5
BRONN," Oh, you won't be swinging it at me.",7,5
BRONN, I'll leave you to it.,7,5
TYRION, I needed to see you and I knew you'd never agree to meet.,7,5
TYRION," You made me look like a complete fool. I thought I'd surprise you by hitting Casterly Rock, but you were three steps ahead of me. You abandoned the family home. Completely unsentimental. Father would have been proud.",7,5
JAIME, Don't talk about our father.,7,5
TYRION, Listen to me --,7,5
JAIME, I once told Bronn that if I ever saw you again I'd cut you in half.,7,5
TYRION, It would take you awhile with a sparring sword.,7,5
TYRION," He was going to execute me. He knew I was innocent. He didn't hate me because of anything I did, he hated me because of what I am. The little monster sent to punish him. Do you think I wanted to be born this way? Did he think I chose --",7,5
JAIME, What do you want?,7,5
TYRION, Daenerys will win this war. You're a military man. You must know there is no way around it. Daenerys is not her father. She's even willing to suspend hostilities if Cersei agrees to certain terms.,7,5
JAIME, You want Cersei to bend the knee you can ask her yourself.,7,5
TYRION, I -- I don't. Daenerys doesn't. Not right now anyway. She has a more important request.,7,5
CUT TO, KING'S LANDING - FLEA BOTTOM,7,5
DAVOS, I wasn't sure I'd find you.,7,5
DAVOS, I thought you might still be rowing.,7,5
DAVOS," I looked in shops, taverns, brothels. I should have known to come straight to the Street of Steel.",7,5
GENDRY, Weren't you worried about the Goldcloaks?,7,5
DAVOS, I haven't been here in years. Why should they recognize me? Sometimes I hardly do. Nothing fucks you harder than time.,7,5
DAVOS, Anybody give you any trouble?,7,5
GENDRY, Here I am arming Lannisters. I never get a second look. You were right. Safest place for me was right under the queen's nose.,7,5
DAVOS, Don't be so sure. Safety is never a permanent state of affairs. Bad things are coming.,7,5
GENDRY, You came to get me. You want me to come with you.,7,5
DAVOS, I think you need to understand --,7,5
GENDRY, I'm ready. Let's go.,7,5
DAVOS, You should know what you're heading into.,7,5
GENDRY, Don't you think I've been thinking about it every swing of the hammer... how happy I am making weapons for the family that killed my father? They tried to kill me.,7,5
GENDRY," I've been getting ready. I never knew what for, but I've always known I'd know it when it comes.",7,5
DAVOS, You might want to bring one of those swords.,7,5
GENDRY," I don't know much about swinging swords, but this --",7,5
GENDRY, -- this I know.,7,5
CUT TO, KING'S LANDING - BEACH,7,5
DAVOS, Keep your father's name to yourself. The situation is complicated enough already.,7,5
GENDRY, Who should I say I am?,7,5
DAVOS," I told you, Clovis, if we don't get out of here soon someone is going to --",7,5
GUARD 1, You there.,7,5
DAVOS," No weapons, friends. I promise. What can I do for you?",7,5
GUARD 1, Is that your boat?,7,5
DAVOS, It is.,7,5
GUARD 2, The docks are that way.,7,5
GENDRY, That they are. I try to stay away from them to avoid good men such as yourselves.,7,5
DAVOS, Still five gold dragons?,7,5
GUARD 1, Are you joking?,7,5
GUARD 2, You must be even older than you look. 15.,7,5
DAVOS, 15?,7,5
GUARD 1, Apiece.,7,5
DAVOS, I can't say it was a pleasure doing business with you.,7,5
GUARD 1, What's in the boat?,7,5
DAVOS, Not more gold.,7,5
GUARD 2, Wine?,7,5
GUARD 1, Mmm.,7,5
GUARD 2, I like wine.,7,5
GUARD 1, Or hams.,7,5
DAVOS, Come and have a look.,7,5
DAVOS, Fermented crab.,7,5
GUARD 2, What?,7,5
DAVOS," Fermented crab. One bucket of this triples the brothel's earnings for the week. A man thinks he's done, he's ready to go back to his loving family, but before he gets his britches up his lady of the hour pops a tiny spoon of that into his mouth. Five minutes later, he's back in the race. Here, have a taste.",7,5
DAVOS, I'd hurry to your favorite establishment or you'll put a whole in that chainmail.,7,5
GUARD 2," Oi, Dwarf!",7,5
DAVOS, I really wouldn't try anymore until you see how the first bite hits you.,7,5
GUARD 2, That dwarf --,7,5
GUARD 1, Where did you get that scar?,7,5
TYRION, Fish hook. Some men you just can't teach.,7,5
GUARD 2, We was looking for a dwarf with a scar like that awhile back.,7,5
DAVOS, Perhaps there's some arrangement?,7,5
GUARD 2, Arrangement? You gonna arrange to pay us more than Queen Cersei?,7,5
DAVOS, This is Gendry.,7,5
TYRION, He'll do.,7,5
CUT TO, REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS,7,5
CERSEI, That won't be necessary.,7,5
QYBURN, Ser Jaime.,7,5
JAIME, Why was QYBURN here?,7,5
CERSEI, He's Hand of the Queen. Why are you here?,7,5
JAIME, I met with Tyrion.,7,5
CERSEI, What did our brother have to say?,7,5
JAIME, Daenerys wants to meet.,7,5
CERSEI, To discuss a surrender?,7,5
JAIME, To discuss an armistice.,7,5
CERSEI, She just won a great victory. Why would she want a truce now?,7,5
JAIME, Because an army of dead men is marching on the Seven Kingdoms. Tyrion claims he'll have proof.,7,5
CERSEI, Are you going to punish him?,7,5
JAIME, Tyrion?,7,5
CERSEI, Bronn.,7,5
CERSEI, He betrayed you. He set up a meeting without your knowledge or consent. Do you think anything of importance happens in this city without me knowing?,7,5
JAIME, You let it happen. Why?,7,5
CERSEI," I've come to believe that accomodation with the Dragon Queen could be in our immediate interest. She has the numbers. If we want to beat her we have to be clever. We have to fight her like father would have. Dead men, dragons and Dragon Queens, whatever stands in our way we will defeat it ourselves for our house. For this.",7,5
JAIME, Who will you say is the father?,7,5
CERSEI, You.,7,5
JAIME, People won't like that.,7,5
CERSEI, Do you remember what father used to say about people?,7,5
JAIME, The lion doesn't concern himself with the opinions of the sheep.,7,5
CERSEI, Never betray me again.,7,5
CUT TO, DRAGONSTONE - BEACH,7,5
DAVOS, We're leaving today. The king's got a lot on his mind.,7,5
GENDRY, I understand.,7,5
DAVOS, He doesn't need to be thinking about harboring the bastard of a dead king.,7,5
GENDRY, You don't have to worry.,7,5
DAVOS," You're just Clovis, a smith who's come to pay his respects before he heads off to work at the Winterfell forges.",7,5
GENDRY, Understood.,7,5
DAVOS," Begging your pardon, Your Grace.",7,5
JON, You survived King's Landing.,7,5
DAVOS, Yet again.,7,5
JON," Your Grace, this is --",7,5
GENDRY," It's Gendry, Your Grace. I'm Robert Baratheon's son. Bastard son.",7,5
DAVOS, He was meant to keep that to himself.,7,5
GENDRY, Our fathers trusted each other. Why shouldn't we?,7,5
JON, I saw your father once at Winterfell.,7,5
GENDRY, I met yours in my shop.,7,5
JON, You're a lot leaner.,7,5
GENDRY, You're a lot shorter.,7,5
JON, I grew up on stories about them.,7,5
GENDRY," All I ever knew was they fought together and won. Ser Davos told me where you're going, Your Grace, and why. Let me come with you.",7,5
DAVOS, Don't be a fool. You're not a soldier.,7,5
GENDRY," No, but I'm a fighter. And he won't be needing a smith with a sword like that.",7,5
JON, Do you know how to use one?,7,5
JON," Well, that's a problem.",7,5
GENDRY, I prefer a hammer.,7,5
DAVOS, He can handle himself.,7,5
JON, We could use the help.,7,5
DAVOS," As my father used to say, it's better to be a coward for a minute than dead for the rest of your life.",7,5
GENDRY(to DAVOS)," I owe you my life. Twice over. But if what you said is true about what's out there, I can't wait out this war.",7,5
DAVOS, Yeah. Nobody mind me. All I've ever done is live to a ripe old age.,7,5
CUT TO, DRAGONSTONE - BEACH,7,5
TYRION," You may not believe it, but I've missed you Mormont. Nobody glowers quite like you. Not even Grey Worm.",7,5
TYRION, This is the coin the slaver gave me when I suggested he free us and pay us. Remember?,7,5
JORAH, It was supposed to last us the rest of our lives.,7,5
TYRION, Take it with you. You'll bring it back. Our queen needs you.,7,5
DAENERYS, We should be better at saying farewell by now.,7,5
JORAH," Your Grace, I --",7,5
JON, If I don't return at least you won't have to deal with the King in the North anymore.,7,5
DAENERYS, But I've grown used to him.,7,5
JON," I wish you good fortune in the wars to come, Your Grace.",7,5
JON, Heave!,7,5
CUT TO, CITADEL - SAMWELL's QUARTERS,7,5
GILLY, Do you know how many steps there are in the Citadel?,7,5
SAM, No.,7,5
GILLY," 15,782.",7,5
GILLY, Guess how many windows are in the Great Sept of Baelor.,7,5
SAMWELL, None anymore.,7,5
GILLY," That's true. This High Septon Meynard, he recorded everything. He even recorded his own bowel movements. What does ""annulment"" mean?",7,5
SAMWELL, It's when a man sets asside his lawful wife.,7,5
GILLY, Meynard says here that he issued an anullment for Prince Rhaegar and remarried him to someone else at the same time in a secret ceremony in Dorne. Is that a common thing --,7,5
SAMWELL," These maesters, they set me to the task of preserving that man's window counting and anullments and bowel movements for all eternity while the secret to defeating the Night King's probably sitting on some dusty shelf somewhere completely ignored. But that's all right, isn't it. We could all become slavering, murderous imbecils enthralled to evil incarnate as long as we can have access to the full records of High Septon Meynard's 15,782 shits.",7,5
GILLY, Steps. That number was steps.,7,5
CUT TO, CITADEL - LIBRARY,7,5
CUT TO, EXT. CITADEL,7,5
GILLY, Are you sure you want to do this? You always wanted to be a maester.,7,5
SAMWELL, I'm tired of reading about the achievements of better men.,7,5
CUT TO, WINTERFELL - KENNELS,7,5
CUT TO, WINTERFELL - COURTYARD,7,5
CUT TO, WINTERFELL - HALLS,7,5
WOLKAN," I found it, my Lord.",7,5
WOLKAN, It took some searching. Maester Llewyn's archives are thorough.,7,5
BAELISH, Are you sure this is the only copy at Winterfell?,7,5
WOLKAN," Yes, my Lord.",7,5
BAELISH, Lady Stark thanks you for your service.,7,5
"""Robb, I write to you with a heavy heart. Our good king Robert is dead, killed from wounds he took in a boar hunt. Father has been charged with treason. He conspired with Robert's brothers against my beloved Joffrey and tried to steal his throne. The Lannisters are treating me very well and provide me with every comfort. I beg you"," come to King's Landing, swear fealty to King Joffrey and prevent any strife between the great houses of Lannister and Stark. Your faithfull sister, Sansa.""",7,5
CUT TO, EASTWATCH - BEACH,7,5
CUT TO, INT. EASTWATCH - GREAT HALL,7,5
TORMUND, Isn't it your job to talk him out of stupid fucking ideas like this?,7,5
DAVOS, I've been failing at that job of late.,7,5
TORMUND, How many queens are there now?,7,5
JON, Two.,7,5
TORMUND, And you need to convince the one with the dragons or the one who fucks her brother?,7,5
JON, Both.,7,5
TORMUND, How many men did you bring?,7,5
JON, Not enough.,7,5
TORMUND, The big woman?,7,5
JORAH, We were hoping some of your men could help.,7,5
DAVOS, I'll be staying behind. I'm a liability out there as you well know.,7,5
TORMUND, You are.,7,5
TORMUND, You really want to go out there again?,7,5
TORMUND, You're not the only ones.,7,5
CUT TO, EASTWATCH - CELLS,7,5
TORMUND, My scouts found them a mile south of the Wall. Said they were on their way here.,7,5
JON, You're The Hound. I saw you once at Winterfell.,7,5
TORMUND, They want to go beyond the Wall too.,7,5
BERIC," We don't want to go beyond the Wall, we have to. Our lord told us the great war is coming.",7,5
GENDRY, Don't trust them. Don't trust any of them.,7,5
GENDRY, They're the Brotherhood. And the last thing their Lord told them to do was sell me to a Red Witch to be murdered.,7,5
JORAH, Thoros?,7,5
JORAH, I hardly recognized you.,7,5
THOROS, Ser Jorah Mormont --,7,5
THOROS, They won't give me anything to drink down here. I haven't been feeling like myself.,7,5
TORMUND, You're a fucking Mormont? Like the last Lord Commander?,7,5
JORAH, He was my father.,7,5
TORMUND, He hunted us like animals.,7,5
JORAH," You returned the favor, as I recall.",7,5
BERIC, Here we all are at the edge of the world at the same moment heading in the same direction for the same reason.,7,5
DAVOS, Our reasons aren't your reasons.,7,5
BERIC, It doesn't matter what we think our reasons are.,7,5
BERIC, There's a greater purpose at work and we serve it together whether we know it or not. We may take the steps but the Lord of Light --,7,5
SANDOR," For fuck's sake, will you shut your hole. Are we coming with you or not?",7,5
JORAH, Don't you want to know what we're doing?,7,5
THOROS, Is it worse than sitting in a freezing cell waiting to die?,7,5
JON, He's right. We're all on the same side.,7,5
GENDRY, How can we be?,7,5
JON, We're all breathing.,7,5
CUT TO, EASTWATCH - RANGER GATE,7,5
CUT TO, BEYOND THE WALL,7,6
JON(to Gendry), Are you all right?,7,6
JON, Ever been north before?,7,6
GENDRY, Never seen snow before.,7,6
TORMUND," Beautiful, eh? I can breath again. Down south the air smells like pig shit.",7,6
JON, You've never been down south.,7,6
TORMUND, I've been to Winterfell.,7,6
JON, That's the north.,7,6
GENDRY(to TORMUND), How do you live up here? How do you keep your balls from freezing off?,7,6
TORMUND," You have to keep moving. That's the secret. Walking is good, fighting is better, fucking is best.",7,6
JON, There's not another woman within 100 miles of here.,7,6
TORMUND, We have to make due with what we've got.,7,6
TORMUND, This one is maybe not so smart.,7,6
JON, Davos says he is a strong fighter.,7,6
TORMUND, Good. That's more important than being smart.,7,6
TORMUND," Smart people don't come up here looking for the dead. So, you met this Dragon Queen, huh? And?",7,6
JON, She'll only fight beside us if I bend the knee.,7,6
TORMUND," You spent too much time with the free folk and now you don't like kneeling. Mance Rayder was a great man, a proud man. The king beyond the wall never bent the knee. How many of his people died for his pride?",7,6
THOROS," Are you still mad at us, boy?",7,6
GENDRY, You sold me to a witch.,7,6
THOROS," Priestess. I'll admit, it is a subtle distinction.",7,6
BERIC, We're fighting a great war. Wars cost money.,7,6
GENDRY," I wanted to be one of you. I wanted to join the Brotherhood but you sold me off like a slave. Do you know what she did to me? She strapped me down on a bed, she stripped me naked --",7,6
SANDOR, Sounds all right so far.,7,6
GENDRY, -- and put leeches on me.,7,6
SANDOR, Was she naked too?,7,6
THOROS, She needed your blood.,7,6
GENDRY, Yes. Thank you. I know that.,7,6
SANDOR, It could have been worse.,7,6
GENDRY, She wanted to kill me. They would have killed me if it wasn't for Davos --,7,6
SANDOR," But they didn't, did they? So what you whinging about?",7,6
GENDRY, I'm not whinging.,7,6
SANDOR, Your lips are moving and you're complaining about something. That's whinging.,7,6
SANDOR, This one's been killed six times. You don't hear him bitching about it.,7,6
THOROS, Good lad.,7,6
JON, The first time I went north of the wall was with your father.,7,6
JORAH, He was a good man. He deserved a better son. Were you with him at the end?,7,6
JON, I was a prisoner of the Wildlings. But we avenged him. I want you to know that every mutineer found justice.,7,6
JORAH," I can't think of a worse way for him to go. The Night's Watch was his life. He would have died to protect every one of those men, and they butchered him.",7,6
JON, I hate that he died that way. My father was the most honorable man I ever met. He was good all the way through. And he died on the executioner's block.,7,6
JORAH, Your father wanted to execute me.,7,6
JON, I heard.,7,6
JORAH, He was in the right of course. It didn't make me hate him any less.,7,6
JON, I'm glad he didn't capture you.,7,6
JORAH, Me too.,7,6
JON," Your father gave me this sword. He changed the pommel from a bear to a wolf, but it's still Long Claw.",7,6
JON, Lord Commander Mormont thought you'd never come back to Westeros.,7,6
JON, But you are back and it's been in your family for centuries. It's not right for me to have it.,7,6
JORAH, He gave it to you.,7,6
JON, I'm not his son.,7,6
JORAH, I brought shame to my house. I broke my father's heart.,7,6
JORAH, I forfeited the right to claim this sword. It's yours. May it serve you well and your children after you.,7,6
CUT TO, WINTERFELL - COURTYARD,7,6
ARYA, Father used to watch us from up here. He wouldn't say much. You probably don't remember. You were inside knitting all the time.,7,6
SANSA, I remember.,7,6
ARYA," One time the boys were shooting arrows with Ser Rodrick. I came out here after and Bran had left his bow behind just lying on the ground. Ser Rodrick would have cuffed him if he saw. There was one arrow in the target. There was no one around, just like now. No one to stop me. So I started shooting. And every shot I had to go out there and get my one arrow and walk back and shoot it again. I wasn't very good. Finally I hit the bullseye. It could have been the 20th shot or the 50th. I don't remember. But I hit the bullseye and I heard this.",7,6
ARYA, I looked up and he's standing right here smiling down at me. I knew what I was doing was against the rules. But he was smiling so I knew it wasn't wrong. The rules were wrong. I was doing what I was meant to be doing and he knew it. Now he's dead. Killed by the Lannisters with your help.,7,6
SANSA, What?,7,6
ARYA," That's your pretty handwriting. Septa Mordane used to crack my knuckles because I couldn't write as well as you. ""Robb, I write to you today with heavy heart. Our good King Robert is dead. Killed from wounds he took in a boar hunt --",7,6
SANSA, You don't have to read it. I remember.,7,6
ARYA," ""Father has been charged with treason. He conspired with Robert's brothers against my beloved Joffrey and tried to steal his throne. The Lannisters are treating me well and providing me with every comfort. I beg you, come to King's Landing, swear fealty to King Joffrey and prevent any strife between the great houses of Lannister and Stark. Your faithful sister, Sansa.""",7,6
SANSA, They forced me to do it.,7,6
ARYA, Did they. With a knife at your throat? Did they put you on a rack and stretch you until your bones started to pop?,7,6
SANSA, You don't know what it was like. I was a child.,7,6
ARYA, So was I. I would have let them kill me before I betrayed my family.,7,6
SANSA, They told me it was the only way to save father.,7,6
ARYA, And you were stupid enough to believe them. I remember you standing on that platform with Joffrey and Cersei when they dragged father too the block. I remember the pretty dress you were wearing. I remember the fancy way you did your hair.,7,6
SANSA, You were there?,7,6
ARYA, I was there standing in the crowd near Baelor's statue.,7,6
SANSA, And what did you do? Did you come running to the rescue? Did you fight off the Lannisters and save father?,7,6
ARYA, I wanted to.,7,6
SANSA, But you didn't. Just like me.,7,6
ARYA, I didn't betray him. I didn't betray Robb. I didn't betray our entire family for my beloved Joffrey.,7,6
SANSA," You should be on your knees thanking me. We're standing in Winterfell again because of me. You didn't win it back. Jon didn't win it back. He lost the Battle of the Bastards. The Knight's of the Vale won the battle and they rode north for me while you were off where, traveling the world?",7,6
ARYA, I was training.,7,6
SANSA," Training. Well, while you were training I suffered things you can never imagine.",7,6
ARYA," Oh, I don't know about that. I can imagine quite a lot.",7,6
SANSA, You never would have survived what I survived.,7,6
ARYA, I guess we'll never know.,7,6
SANSA, What are you doing to do with that letter.,7,6
ARYA, I don't know yet.,7,6
SANSA, Who did you show it to? Where did you find it?,7,6
ARYA," You're scared, aren't you? What are you scared of? You didn't commit any crimes. No one's going to hang you.",7,6
SANSA, Arya --,7,6
ARYA, Are you scared I'll show it to Jon and he'll be angry? No. That's not Jon. He'll understand. You were just a scared little girl all alone with the wicked Lannisters.,7,6
SANSA," Do you know how happy Cersei would be if she saw us fighting? This is exactly what she wants. This is what she's always wanted, to tear us apart --",7,6
ARYA," The northern lords will read it. They wouldn't think much of Lady Sansa if they knew how she did Cersei's bidding. What would little Lyanna Mormont say? She's younger than you were when you wrote this. Are you going to say, ""But I was just a child""?",7,6
SANSA, You're angry. Sometimes anger makes people do unfortunate things.,7,6
ARYA, Sometimes fear makes them do unfortunate things. I'll go with anger.,7,6
CUT TO, - BEYOND THE WALL,7,6
TORMUND, You're one big ugly dog.,7,6
SANDOR, Fuck off.,7,6
TORMUND, They told me you were mean. Were you born mean or you just hate Wildlings?,7,6
SANDOR, I don't give two shits about Wildlings.,7,6
SANDOR, Gingers I hate.,7,6
TORMUND, Gingers are beautiful. We are kissed by fire. Just like you.,7,6
SANDOR, Don't point your fucking finger at me.,7,6
TORMUND, Did you trip into the fire when you were a baby?,7,6
SANDOR, I didn't trip. I was pushed.,7,6
TORMUND, Ever since you've been mean.,7,6
SANDOR, Will you fuck off?,7,6
TORMUND, I don't think you're truly mean. You have sad eyes.,7,6
SANDOR, Do you want to suck my dick? Is that it?,7,6
TORMUND, Dick?,7,6
SANDOR, Cock.,7,6
TORMUND, Ah. Dick. I like it.,7,6
SANDOR, I bet you do.,7,6
TORMUND, Nope. It's pussy for me. I have a beauty waiting for me back at Winterfell. If I ever get back there. Yellow hair. Blue eyes. Tallest woman you've ever seen. Almost as tall as you.,7,6
SANDOR, Brienne of Tarth.,7,6
TORMUND, You know her?,7,6
SANDOR, You're with Brienne of fucking Tarth?,7,6
TORMUND," Well, not with her yet, but I see the way she looks at me.",7,6
SANDOR, How does she look at you? Like she wants to carve you up and eat your liver?,7,6
TORMUND, You do know her.,7,6
SANDOR, We've met.,7,6
TORMUND, I want to make babies with her. Think of the great big monsters. They'd conquer the world.,7,6
SANDOR, How did a mad fucker like you live this long?,7,6
TORMUND, I'm good at killing people.,7,6
BERIC, You don't much look like him.,7,6
JON, Who's that?,7,6
BERIC, Your father. I suppose you favor your mother.,7,6
JON, You knew him?,7,6
BERIC, Of course I did. When he was Hand he sent me off hunting for The Mountain. Your Wildling friend told me the red woman brought you back. Thoros has brought me back six times. We both serve the same lord.,7,6
JON, I serve the north.,7,6
BERIC, The north didn't raise you from the dead.,7,6
JON, The lord of light never spoke to me. I don't know anything about him. I don't know what he wants from me.,7,6
BERIC, He wants you alive.,7,6
JON, Why?,7,6
BERIC, I don't know.,7,6
JON," That's all anyone can tell me, I don't know. So what's the point in serving a god that none of us knows what he wants.",7,6
BERIC, I think about that all the time. I don't think it's our purpose to understand except one thing. We're soldiers. We have to know what we're fighting for. I'm not fighting so some man or woman I barely know can sit on a throne made of swords.,7,6
JON, So what are you fighting for?,7,6
BERIC, Life. Death is the enemy. The first enemy and the last.,7,6
JON, But we all die.,7,6
BERIC, The enemy always wins. And we still need to fight him. That's all I know. You and I wont find much joy while we're here. But we can keep others alive. We can defend those who can't defend themselves.,7,6
JON," ""I am the shield that guards the realms of men.""",7,6
BERIC, Maybe we don't need to understand any more than that. Maybe that's enough.,7,6
JON, Aye. Maybe that's enough.,7,6
SANDOR, That's what I saw in the fire.,7,6
SANDOR, A mountain like an arrowhead.,7,6
THOROS, Are you sure?,7,6
SANDOR, We're getting close.,7,6
CUT TO, DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE,7,6
DAENERYS, Do you know what I like about you?,7,6
TYRION, I honestly don't.,7,6
DAENERYS, You're not a hero.,7,6
TYRION, Oh. I've been heroic on occasion.,7,6
TYRION, I once charged through the mud gate of King's Landing.,7,6
DAENERYS," I don't want you to be a hero. Heroes do stupid things and they die. Drogo, Jorah, Dario, even this Jon Snow, they all try to outdo each other of who can do the stupidist, bravest thing.",7,6
TYRION," It's interesting these heroes you name. Drogo, Jorah, Dario, even this Jon Snow, they all fell in love with you.",7,6
DAENERYS, Jon Snow's not in love with me.,7,6
TYRION," Oh, my mistake. I suppose he stares at you longingly because he's hopeful for a successful military alliance.",7,6
Beric Dondarrion, Thoros? Thoros?,7,6
Sandor Clegane, They say it's one of the better ways to go.,7,6
Beric Dondarrion," Lord of Light, show us the Way. Come to us in our darkness, and lead your servant into the light.",7,6
Jon Snow, We have to burn his body.,7,6
Tormund Giantsbane," We'll all be close behind him, unless the Lord of Light is kind enough to send us a bit of fire.",7,6
Beric Dondarrion," Lord of Light, come to us in our darkness. For the night is dark, and full of terrors.",7,6
Jorah Mormont," [to Jon] We'll all freeze, soon. When you killed the White Walker... almost all the dead that followed it fell. Why?",7,6
Jon Snow, Maybe he was the one who turned them.,7,6
Jorah Mormont, We can go for the Walkers; maybe we'll stand a chance.,7,6
Jon Snow, No. [Indicating their captured wight] We need to take that thing back with us. There's a raven flying for Dragonstone now. Daenerys is our only chance.,7,6
Beric Dondarrion, No. There's another. [points his sword at the Night King] Kill him. He turned them all.,7,6
Jon Snow, You don't understand.,7,6
Beric Dondarrion," The Lord brought you back, and he brought me back. No one else, just us. Did he do it to watch us freeze to death?",7,6
Sandor Clegane," Careful, Beric. You lost your priest. This is your last life.",7,6
Beric Dondarrion, I've been waiting for the end for a long time. Maybe the Lord brought me here to find it.,7,6
Sandor Clegane, Every lord I've ever met's been a cunt. Don't see why the Lord of Light should be any different.,7,6
Jon Snow, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I wish I could take it back. I wish we'd never gone.,7,6
Daenerys Targaryen," I don't. If we hadn't gone, I wouldn't have seen. You have to see it to know. Now I know. [tearful] The dragons are my children. They're the only children I'll ever have, do you understand? We are going to destroy the Night King and his army...and we'll do it together. You have my word.",7,6
Jon Snow," Thank you, Dany.",7,6
Daenerys Targaryen, Dany? [chuckles] Who was the last person who called me that? I'm not sure. Was it my brother? Not the company you want to keep.,7,6
Jon Snow," Alright, not Dany. How about ""My Queen""? I'd, uh, bend the knee, but-",7,6
Daenerys Targaryen, What about those who swore allegiance to you?,7,6
Jon Snow, They'll all come to see you for what you are.,7,6
Daenerys Targaryen, I hope I deserve it.,7,6
Jon Snow, You do.,7,6
Daenerys Targaryen, You should rest.,7,6
Tyrion Lannister," We are a group of people who do not like each other, as this demonstration has shown. We have suffered at each other's hands. We've lost people we love at each other's hands. If all we wanted was more of the same, there would be no need for this gathering. We are entirely capable of waging war with each other without meeting face to face.",7,7
Cersei Lannister, So instead we should settle our differences and live together in harmony for the rest of our days?,7,7
Tyrion Lannister, We all know that will never happen.,7,7
Cersei Lannister, Then why are we here?,7,7
Jon Snow," This isn't about living in harmony; it's just about living. The same thing is coming for all of us; a general you can't negotiate with, an army that doesn't leave corpses behind on the battlefield. Lord Tyrion tells me a million people live in this city...they're about to become a million more soldiers in the army of the dead.",7,7
Cersei Lannister," I imagine for most of them, that would be an improvement.",7,7
Jon Snow, This is serious! I wouldn't be here if it weren't.,7,7
Cersei Lannister," I don't think it's serious at all. I think it's another bad joke. If my brother Jaime has informed me correctly, you're asking for a truce?",7,7
Daenerys Targaryen, Yes. That's all.,7,7
Cersei Lannister," ""That's all?"" Pull back my armies and stand down while you go on your monster hunt? Or while you solidify and expand your position? Hard to know which it is with my armies pulled back until you return and march on my capital with four times the men!",7,7
Daenerys Targaryen, Your capital will be safe until the Northern threat is dealt with. You have my word.,7,7
Cersei Lannister, The word of a would-be usurper!,7,7
Tyrion Lannister, There is no conversation that will erase the last fifty years. We have something to show you.,7,7
Jon Snow," We can destroy them by burning them, and we can destroy them with dragonglass. [Jon draws a dragonglass dagger and stabs the wight in the heart, killing it] If we don't win this fight, then that is the fate of every person in the world! There is only one war that matters. The Great War...and it is here!",7,7
Cersei Lannister," [about Daenerys] I shouldn't be surprised, I suppose. She's your kind of woman: a foreign whore who doesn't know her place.",7,7
Cersei Lannister," [about Daenerys] I shouldn't be surprised, I suppose. She's your kind of woman: a foreign whore who doesn't know her place.",7,7
Tyrion Lannister," A foreign whore you can't abduct, beat or intimidate. That must be difficult for you.",7,7
Cersei Lannister," So you bring her here, with her pet Northerner, whom you have convinced to bow down before her?",7,7
Tyrion Lannister, I didn't know about that.,7,7
Cersei Lannister," And now you've got them both working towards the same goal, the goal you've worked towards your entire life.",7,7
Tyrion Lannister," Cersei, I didn't know!",7,7
Cersei Lannister, The destruction of this family.,7,7
Tyrion Lannister," I am the one preventing that from happening. Daenerys didn't want to debate and negotiate, she didn't want to bring you words! She wanted to bring you fire and blood until I advised her otherwise! I don't want to destroy our family, I never have.",7,7
Cersei Lannister, You killed our father.,7,7
Tyrion Lannister," After he sentenced me to death for a crime I didn't commit. Yes, I killed him. Hate me for it, if you want; I hate myself for it, in spite of what he was, in spite of what he did to me.",7,7
Cersei Lannister," Oh, poor little man, your papa was mean to you. Do you have any idea what you did when you fired that crossbow? You left us open. You laid us bare for the vultures, and the vultures came and tore us apart. You may not have killed Joffrey, but you killed Myrcella, you killed Tommen! No one would have touched them if Father was here, no one would have dared!",7,7
Tyrion Lannister, I have never been more sorry about anything...,7,7
Cersei Lannister," I won't hear it, not from you. I will NOT hear it!",7,7
Tyrion Lannister," All right. You love your family, and I have destroyed it. I will always be a threat. So, put an end to me. If it weren't for me, you'd have a mother, if it weren't for me, you'd have a father. If it weren't for me, you'd have two beautiful children! I've thought about killing you more times than I can count! DO IT! Say the word.",7,7
Tyrion Lannister, I am more sorry about the children than you can ever know.,7,7
Cersei Lannister, I will not...,7,7
Tyrion Lannister," I don't care! I loved them. You know I did. You know it in your heart, if there's anything left of it.",7,7
Cersei Lannister," Doesn't matter. Your love doesn't matter, your feelings don't matter. I don't care why you did what you did, I only care what it cost us. It cost us our future.",7,7
Tyrion Lannister," If there's no future, then why are we here? Why did you allow me to come?",7,7
Cersei Lannister, Not to help my enemies collaborate in my destruction.,7,7
Tyrion Lannister," Yes, I know, not what you hoped for, but you must have hoped for something!",7,7
Cersei Lannister, What did you hope for? To make Jon Snow submit to your Queen?,7,7
Tyrion Lannister, Not like this.,7,7
Cersei Lannister," But, eventually, you want everyone to bend the knee to her.",7,7
Tyrion Lannister, Yes.,7,7
Cersei Lannister, Why?,7,7
Tyrion Lannister, Because I think she will make the world a better place.,7,7
Cersei Lannister, You said she'd destroy King's Landing.,7,7
Tyrion Lannister," She knows herself. She chose an adviser who would check her worst impulses, instead of feeding them. That's the difference between you.",7,7
Cersei Lannister," I don't care about checking my worst impulses. I don't care about making the world a better place. Hang the world. [rubs her belly] That thing you dragged here, I know what it is, I know what it means. And when it came at me, I didn't think about the world, not at all. As soon as it opened its mouth, the world disappeared for me, right down its black throat. All I could think about was keeping those gnashing teeth away from the ones who matter most, away from my family. Maybe Euron Greyjoy had the right idea: get on a boat, take those who matter—",7,7
Cersei Lannister," I don't care about checking my worst impulses. I don't care about making the world a better place. Hang the world. [rubs her belly] That thing you dragged here, I know what it is, I know what it means. And when it came at me, I didn't think about the world, not at all.

All I could think about was keeping those gnashing teeth away from the ones who matter most, away from my family. Maybe Euron Greyjoy had the right idea: get on a boat, take those who matter—",7,7
Tyrion Lannister, You're pregnant.,7,7
Jon Snow, No one's less happy about this than I am.,7,7
Daenerys Targaryen," I know. I respect what you did. Wish you hadn't done it, but I respect it. This place was the beginning of the end for my family. Zaldrizes buzdari iksos daor. ""A dragon is not a slave"". They were terrifying, extraordinary. They filled people with wonder and awe, and we locked them in here. They wasted away. They grew small. And we grew small, as well. We weren't extraordinary without them. We were just like everyone else.",7,7
Jon Snow, You're not like everyone else. And your family hasn't seen its end. You're still here.,7,7
Daenerys Targaryen, I can't have children.,7,7
Jon Snow, Who told you that?,7,7
Daenerys Targaryen, The witch who murdered my husband.,7,7
Jon Snow, Has it occurred to you she might not've been a reliable source of information?,7,7
Daenerys Targaryen," You were right, from the beginning. If I'd trusted you, everything would've been different.",7,7
Jon Snow," So, what now?",7,7
Daenerys Targaryen," I can't forget what I saw, North of the Wall. And I can't pretend that Cersei won't take back half the country the moment I march North.",7,7
Jon Snow, It appears that Tyrion's assessment was correct. We're fucked.,7,7
Arya Stark, Are you sure you want to do this?,7,7
Sansa Stark," It's not what I want, it's what honor demands.",7,7
Arya Stark, And what does honor demand?,7,7
Sansa Stark, That I defend my family from those who would harm us. That I defend the North from those who would betray us.,7,7
Arya Stark," All right, then. Get on with it.",7,7
Sansa Stark," [seeming to speak to Arya] You stand accused of murder, you stand accused of treason. How do you answer these charges...[glancing over at Petyr Baelish] Lord Baelish?",7,7
Petyr Baelish," Lady Sansa, I have known you since you were a girl. I have protected you...",7,7
Sansa Stark, Protected me? By selling me to the Boltons?,7,7
Petyr Baelish," If we could speak alone, I can explain everything...",7,7
Sansa Stark," [quoting Petyr] ""Sometimes, when I'm trying to understand a person's motives, I play a little game. I assume the worst."" What's the worst reason you have, for turning me against my sister? That's what you do, isn't it? That's what you've always done. Turn family against family, turn sister against sister. That's what you did to our mother and Aunt Lysa, and that's what you tried to do to us.",7,7
Petyr Baelish," Sansa, please.",7,7
Sansa Stark," I'm a slow learner, it's true. But I learn.",7,7
Petyr Baelish, Give me a chance to defend myself. I deserve that. [to Yohn Royce] I am Lord Protector of the Vale and I command you to escort me safely back to the Eyrie.,7,7
Yohn Royce, I think not.,7,7
Petyr Baelish," [kneels before Sansa] Sansa, I beg you! I loved your mother since I was a boy!",7,7
Sansa Stark," And yet, you betrayed her.",7,7
Petyr Baelish, I loved you. More than anyone.,7,7
Sansa Stark," And yet, you betrayed me. When you brought me back to Winterfell, you told me ""there's no justice in the world, not unless we make it."" Thank you for all your many lessons, Lord Baelish. I will never forget them.",7,7
Petyr Baelish, Sansa--,7,7
Bran Stark, Come in. [Sam enters] Samwell Tarly.,7,7
Samwell Tarly, I wasn't sure if you'd remember me.,7,7
Bran Stark, I remember everything. You helped us get beyond the Wall. You're a good man.,7,7
Samwell Tarly," Oh. Well, thank you, but, um, I'm not sure that I am. What happened to you beyond the Wall?",7,7
Bran Stark, I became the Three-Eyed Raven.,7,7
Samwell Tarly, Oh. I don't know what that means.,7,7
Bran Stark," I can see things that happened in the past. I can see things happening now, all over the world. Why did you come to Winterfell?",7,7
Samwell Tarly, Jon's the one to lead the fight against the dead. I know he is. But he can't do it alone. So I've come here to help him.,7,7
Bran Stark, He's on his way back to Winterfell... with Daenerys Targaryen.,7,7
Samwell Tarly, Y-you saw this... in a vision? [Bran holds up a scroll] Oh.,7,7
Bran Stark, He needs to know the truth.,7,7
Samwell Tarly, The truth about what?,7,7
Bran Stark," About himself. No one knows, no one but me. Jon isn't really my father's son. He's the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and my aunt, Lyanna Stark. He was born in a tower in Dorne. His last name isn't really Snow, it's Sand.",7,7
Samwell Tarly, He's not.,7,7
Bran Stark," Dornish bastards are named ""Sand"".",7,7
Samwell Tarly," At the Citadel, I transcribed a High Septon's diary. He annulled Rhaegar's marriage to Elia. He wed Rhaegar and Lyanna in a secret ceremony!",7,7
Bran Stark, Are you certain?,7,7
Samwell Tarly, It's what the High Septon wrote in his private diary. I don't know why he'd lie. Is there something you can see?,7,7
Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark," Father, Smith, Warrior. Mother, Maiden, Crone. Stranger. I am hers/his, and she/he is mine, from this day until the end of my days.",7,7
Bran Stark," Robert's rebellion was built on a lie. Rhaegar didn't kidnap my aunt, or rape her. He loved her. And she loved him. And Jon... Jon's real name...",7,7
Lyanna Stark," [to Ned Stark, in flashback] His name is Aegon Targaryen. You have to protect him. Promise me, Ned.",7,7
Bran Stark, He's never been a bastard. He's the heir to the Iron Throne. He needs to know. We need to tell him.,7,7
Cersei Lannister, What are you doing?,7,7
Jaime Lannister, Preparing the expedition north.,7,7
Cersei Lannister," Expedition north? I always knew you were the stupidest Lannister. [Jaime looks at her in astonishment] The Starks and Targaryens have united against us and you want to fight alongside them. Are you a traitor, or an idiot?",7,7
Jaime Lannister, You pledged our forces to fight our common enemy.,7,7
Cersei Lannister, I'll say whatever I need to say to ensure the survival of our house. You expect me to trust the man who murdered our father? You expect me to command our troops to fight beside foreign scum? To fight for the Dragon Queen?,7,7
Jaime Lannister," You saw it with your own eyes, you saw a dead man trying to kill us!",7,7
Cersei Lannister," And I saw it burn. If dragons can't stop them, if Dothraki and Unsullied and Northmen can't stop them, how will our armies make a difference?",7,7
Jaime Lannister," This isn't about noble houses, this is about the living and the dead!",7,7
Cersei Lannister, And I intend to stay amongst the living. Let the Stark boy and his new queen defend the North. We'll stay here where we've always been.,7,7
Jaime Lannister, I made a promise.,7,7
Cersei Lannister, Our child will rule Westeros.,7,7
Jaime Lannister, Our child will never be born if the dead come south.,7,7
Cersei Lannister," The monsters are real. The White Walkers, the dragons, the Dothraki screamers. All the frightening stories we heard when we were young, they're all real, so be it. Let the monsters kill each other, and while they battle in the North we take back the lands that belong to us.",7,7
Jaime Lannister, And then what?,7,7
Cersei Lannister, And then we rule.,7,7
Jaime Lannister," When the fighting in the North is over, someone wins; you understand that, don't you? If the dead win, they march south and kill us all. If the living win, and we've betrayed them, they march south and kill us all!",7,7
Cersei Lannister, The Targaryens and the Starks already want to kill us all. Most of them will die in the North.,7,7
Jaime Lannister," I faced them in the field. We can't beat them, we can't beat their dragons!",7,7
Cersei Lannister, How many dragons did you see at the pit?,7,7
Jaime Lannister, Two.,7,7
Cersei Lannister, What happened to the third?,7,7
Jaime Lannister," For all we know, it's guarding her fleet!",7,7
Cersei Lannister," She came here with her dragons and her Dothraki and her Unsullied, she came here to show us all her power. No, something happened; the dragons are vulnerable.",7,7
Jaime Lannister," We can't beat the Dothraki! We don't have the numbers, we don't have the support of the other houses!",7,7
Cersei Lannister," No, we have something better - we have the Iron Bank. You should have listened more when Father spoke about the importance of gold. Oh, I know it was boring for you. You just wanted to hunt and ride and fight. But I listened, I learned. Highgarden bought us the most powerful army in Essos - the Golden Company. 20,000 men, horses, elephants, I believe.",7,7
Jaime Lannister, The Golden Company is not here; they're in Essos. How is a mercenary company in Essos going to help us?!,7,7
Cersei Lannister," Do you really think Euron Greyjoy turned tail and sailed back to the Iron Islands? Do you think he abandoned the chance to marry the Queen? No one walks away from me. He's sailing with his fleet to Essos, he's going to ferry the Golden Company back here to help us win the war for Westeros.",7,7
Jaime Lannister," You plotted with Euron Greyjoy without telling me, the commander of your armies?",7,7
Cersei Lannister," And you conspired with Tyrion, the man who murdered our father, without telling me, your Queen.",7,7
Jaime Lannister, I didn't conspire with...,7,7
Cersei Lannister, You met with him in secret without my consent. You planned to promote my enemy's interests! That is the definition of conspiracy.,7,7
Jaime Lannister, I pledged to ride north. I intend to honor that pledge.,7,7
Cersei Lannister, Then that will be treason.,7,7
Jaime Lannister, Treason?!,7,7
Cersei Lannister," Disobeying your queen's command, fighting with her enemies - what would you call it?",7,7
Jaime Lannister, Doesn't matter what I'd call it.,7,7
Cersei Lannister, I told you: no one walks away from me.,7,7
Cersei Lannister, I told you: no one walks away from me.,7,7
Jaime Lannister," Are you going to order him to kill me?! I'm the only one you have left. Our children are gone, our father is gone, it's just me and you now.",7,7
Cersei Lannister, There's one more yet to come.,7,7
Jaime Lannister," Give the order, then.",7,7
Jaime Lannister, I don't believe you.,7,7
